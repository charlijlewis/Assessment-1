Honestly, I thought I had this movie figured out from the trailers but it just kept swerving in the best possible ways.

Loved the worldbuilding. Some light exposition and then handwaves the rest of the way, like Will Ferrell just casually mentioning that Ruth was a ghost with an office. Like, any other movie would've had the humans spend a lot more time questioning if Barbie was Barbie rather than accepting it within a single scene.

Also, can someone tell me what Allen said right before taking on the Kens? My audience was laughing so hard I didn't hear it.

54,"I loved the movie, and am eagerly awaiting the long-expected Culture War it will spark (a few FB friends already lambasting it for woke propaganda).

One observation I havent seen made much is regards to Ken. A few critics have accused the film of ""Pulling its Punches"" with regards to Ken in the end.

How I saw it was that Ken wasn't a representation of Tate/Petersen/RedPill leaders, so much as a representation of the naive 12 year old boys who don't know enough about the world to not fall for it.

(Spoilers below)
Ken's arc concludes with having to realize that his purpose and sense of self-worth should not revolve around his access to women. This feels like something applicable to the incel movement, whete their entire social worldview is rooted on whether or not women will sleep with them. I think that the film didnt so much pull it's punches on the Kens, so much as falter a little on driving home the point that they need to work on themselves before they can earn what they feel 'entitled' to.

Great film, way deeper than it had any right to be, and I've already seen one 90 minute YT review from a neckbeard lambasting the ""woke"" war.

What a time to be alive.

69,"I think someone could write a whole essay about the scene when Barbie told that elderly woman on the bench that she is beautiful.

Barbie had been looking at her new imperfections and saw them as elements that devalue her as a person (or doll). Yet she is able to look at this woman, who has qualities that Barbie would consider flaws if applied to her, and sincerely see her as a beautiful person. It shows that even when Barbie hates herself, she is able to appreciate those around her. We see her compassion and appreciation for others, which contrasts with her personal insecurity.

We also get to see her taking in the real world and it‚Äôs imperfections: some people are having the time of their lives and others are have the worst day of their life. People in the same place aren‚Äôt all going to be collectively happy no matter what, because each person has their own complicated and imperfect life. It‚Äôs a pivotal moment in Barbie‚Äôs character development as a compassionate person and gradual growth into a more confident individual throughout the movie.

*edit* I apologize if a man being like ‚Äúyay, a man!‚Äù regardless of race comes across as ignorant.

76,"Greta Gerwig, we simply do not deserve you. 

I'm so happy to say that after having huge expectations for this movie that I was still blown away by how hilarious it is and how deeply connected to the human experience it feels. 

I loved the dream world of Barbie and every single performance going on there, usually when a movie like this goes to the ""real world"" that's when it starts to go downhill, but not Barbie. Robbie perfectly embodies the abstract concept of the stereotypical Barbie, but when her consciousness gets flipped on and she goes to the real world she has some incredible scenes. I loved how when her and Ken first arrive, she's met with anxiety and seemingly violent aggression, whereas Ken picks up right away that this world was made for him and he feels absolutely none of that. 

It's moments like that that make Barbie truly one of the most interesting and intelligent social commentaries we've gotten in such a big budget. The thematic implications of this movie are insane, and it doesn't feel like they're brought up and brushed aside but rather that Gerwig is using the beautiful artifice of Barbie to really dig into them. It's kind of wild that Mattel even let her go this hard, not just on the themes of social expectation, but also kind of calling them out for being run by businessmen? Will Ferrell being the funniest he's been in years here.

This movie is so much more than a brilliant exploration of feminism and feminiminity. It's about the whole human experience. It's about the difference between what young girls and young boys read about the world and their place in it, it's about our connection to our toys and what plastic models can mean to developing minds, it's about male insecurity and how men are so starved for validation that someone asking them what time it is makes them feel like a king, it's about how men and women interact with each other and how society is so demanding that they pair up, it's about the changing ideas of what feminism or progressivism means now vs then, it's about patriarchy and business ethics and seemingly every feeling that we as people have on a day to day basis. It's about everything.

The plot is exactly what it needs to be to convey all these things. When the mother/daughter plotline got involved I thought maybe this was going to be more tropey than I thought, but it really continued to surprise me at every turn. They weren't there to distract the movie or shove in a kid character, them and Barbie each represented different evolutions of feminism.

America's speech at the end about how criticized women are and how much is expected of them to walk this perfect line between independence and femininity was insanely well written and acted, if this movie just had that to say it would have been great, but there was so much more to this. Really something for everybody here, this isn't just for girls or women but for anybody who experiences the mess of feelings and desires that it is to be human. 

I just fucking loved this. It had me thinking the entire time, but also getting some of the biggest laughs this year in moments like when every Ken was singing Push by Matchbox 20 or every single hilarious thing Gosling did and said. This is an easy 9/10 and it could go higher on rewatches. This will absolutely be my new comfort movie when it comes out on blu ray.

**""Do you know how many times I've wanted to stand up in the boardroom and just say, 'let's all tickle each other!'""**

**""When I realized Patriarchy wasn't all about horses I kind of lost interest in it.""**

89,"

- ""Push"" was the official Ken anthem because Ryan Gosling has been sitting on a first rate Matchbox 20 impression for 25+ years and no, you cannot convince me otherwise.
- If someone doesn't make the tie-dyed *I am Kenough* hoodie available for purchase immediately, it will be a crime. Same goes for Depression Barbie, because I've never felt so seen. She will also be the perfect last minute lazy cosplay idea (she's always wearing sweatpants!) come Halloween or comic convention time. 
- Loved Helen Mirren as the narrator pointing out that Margot Robbie was way too beautiful an actress to believably have an existential crisis over no longer being pretty enough. For real though, Margot literally and figuratively *glowed* the entire time she was onscreen. 
- Shoutout to Greta Gerwig for calling out Justin Timberlake's big ""Just Allan"" energy. Let's be real, we've all sensed it on a spiritual level. 
- America Ferrera was the perfect person to deliver that monologue about what it means to be a woman. It would have been cheesy or clich√©d in a lesser performer's hands, but she really made you feel the rage and exhaustion behind every contradiction. 
- Speaking of performers who elevated the material, how the fuck did Margot Robbie just make me cry in the same movie as an ""I'm Just Ken"" dance battle? Her connection with Ruth and genuine desire to be human got me good, somehow. 
- Shoutout to that one Ken in the battle scene whose weapon of choice was titty twisters. 
- ""As soon as I found out the patriarchy wasn't mainly about horses, I kinda lost interest"" had me dying. Ryan played the lovable himbo so well. Even his heel turn was 75% costume driven. 
- Issa Rae getting the one Mattel bleeped out swear in the movie just felt right. Don't come for President Barbie or she'll put you in your place, motherfucker. 
- The cut to credits joke was flawless. ""I'm here to see my gynecologist"" is 10/10, no notes. Talk about throwing Barbie into the deep end.",2023-07-22 00:38:00,379,movies,lovetheblazer,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

95,"I don‚Äôt get why men take away that this movie is just men=bad. I saw it as Ken having the same existential crisis as Barbie and filling it with his mojo dojo casa house and hypermasculinity. Which as someone who grew with a brother is exactly what I saw my brother go through in adolescence, his crisis made him push away every woman in his life and he was ‚Äúedgy‚Äù. I actually sympathized so much for Ken, specially because he thought his only worth was having a hot woman which is what a lot of men feel pressured to. I felt that the message was very clear men you are enough! (Or Kenough! That hoodie will be sold out in seconds!) and women are also enough! How is that idea anti-men at all? 

I loved this movie and can‚Äôt wait to rewatch. Sure, there‚Äôs themes that I think it could go deeper into, and this movie isn‚Äôt any new ideas but it was so touching and so well done!

107,"I want to comment on something I haven't seen many other comments on. I know it's easy to see Ken as just the patriarchy villain, but I actually think they did a better job at handling it than that. He's pretty obviously an innocent, trying to find his identity in a world he has zero experience in, and his adoption of the patriarchy didn't really feel malicious to me, so much as him trying on an identity to see if it felt right. I felt like they made it obvious that he wasn't really a villain, and more looking for a way to form his own identity in parallel to Barbie having her own journey to do so. Only difference was, she had a guide in real people, and Ken never really did. He seems to let go of it pretty easily at the end, and I think they were making an interesting statement about the ease with which someone with little experience can get suckered in to a darker world view. The toxicity of internet culture, in particular what's geared towards young men comes to mind, and I thought they did a really good job presenting it this way.",2023-07-22 05:00:15,214,movies,bluemoonflame,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

132,"I'm a grown ass man who doesn't have anything pink in his wardrobe. Never cared for anything to do with Barbie or it's fan culture. I went with some friends expecting a cringefest. I had heard all the stuff about how it was the wokest movie ever and trashed men so I was bracing for the worst.


I can't remember the last time I left a cinema feeling as happy as I did leaving this one.


It was super fun throughout. The designs of the sets and characters are a perfect 10. The acting was incredible. I so badly want a Ken spinoff cuz Gosling killed it. The music and dance performances are awesome.


In regards to the themes of the film, I found the ending to be so touching. 


People say the movie trashes men but I found Ken deciding he was Kenough to be heartwarming. There's 2 big struggles we face today as men. Feeling like we need a girl to love us to have any meaning in life and then feeling like we need to be more manly and dominant to be true men. And Gosling managed to make you feel those struggles whilst simultaneously being hilarious and charming whilst doing it. There's no cliche happy ending where the Kens immediately get perfect equality cuz that is something that takes a long time as we see in real life. And that's ok to me cuz it's acknowledged that they will follow the path of women did in real life. 


And a similar thing is done for Barbie's character where she rejects the idea that she needs to be a trailblazer for women after seeing that the fantasy world of Barbieland really wasn't a saviour for women and avoids the stereotypical trope of most movies where the girl falls in love with the guy for a cliche happy ending whilst still apologising for how she treated Ken before. She could have had a life of immortality with systematic privilege but learned that it's not right and being the flawed humans we are is beautiful. People deserve to be acknowledged but are not entitled to love. And the ending gag is just perfect. Funny and also shows the beauty of normalcy. Both the male and female main characters end the movie in a similar way even if with different literal outcomes.


The patriarchy stuff was absolutely hilarious in it's execution and I feel bad for anyone who couldn't enjoy it. The fact that they show that Ken couldn't get a job in the real world out of the virtue of being a man cuz he lacked skills showed that the movie is not literally saying today is a patriarchal oppression but redpillers gonna do what they do. I have conservative views on quite a few topics and am first to call out liberal agendas but this movie was not it to me. I feel like anyone can appreciate it regardless on political leaning if you don't take everything at face value. I also feel like they use the little girl character as a satire of Gen Z liberals who just want to hate everything so it's not like the movie was an F U to conservatives. 
I feel like this movie has something for everybody of any sex,age,political leaning etc and we just need to stop taking ourselves too seriously. 
 

This is a movie that you can take a lot from. But to me,it's about how we don't need to live life having a higher calling from our sex or to dedicate it to chasing a member of the opposite. We just need to be ourselves. 


I'm glad the movie is such a big success. Robbie and Gosling have shot up my list of favourites actresses/actors. Top tier work from both of them.",2023-07-26 00:49:17,109,movies,mcm123456,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
133,"I figured Barbie would be a fun watch but I didn‚Äôt expect to love it as much as I did.  It perfectly toed the line between making fun of Barbie and honoring Barbie.  In order to poke fun at something you need to know it inside and out and the writers did their homework!  All the specific dolls/outfits, how Barbies bend, brushes that don‚Äôt actually brush their hair, those little white twist ties holding them in the box-they got every little specific detail right!
 

I thought it was so clever that in the end the Barbie world remains matriarchal but throws a few concessions to the Kens mirroring the real world where the world remains patriarchal but has essentially thrown a few concessions to women.  


I also appreciated the acknowledgement Robbie was playing ‚Äústereotypical‚Äù Barbie and that there were lots of different women represented as Barbies in Barbieworld.  As Robbie was crying about feeling bad and unpretty I was about to roll my eyes before Mirren cuts in with the perfect 4th wall break about how Robbie isn‚Äôt the ideal casting choice to deliver this line.  Perfect!  Similar to when the girls at lunch are just like ‚Äúyou are an unrealistic standard.  I mean just look at you!‚Äù  It just felt like every time the writers were about to fall in a trap they wrote themselves out of it.  Even having the mother being the one in need of Barbie rather than the daughter was brilliant!


And of course Gosling.  Gosling was HILARIOUS.  Please keep casting Gosling in comedies.  Barbie, Crazy Stupid Love, The Nice Guys‚Ä¶EXCELLENT!

my country is very religious and patriarchal, and i seldom see western feminist movies bc they arent really available here. 

I was on the edge of my seat all the time and cheering for barbie and ken. haha 

I felt so seen and empowered by the movie. and I laughed a lot as well. all the cast was lovable. 

I really indentified with stereotipical barbie and ken thru this movie. With Barbie bc she wasn't astronaut barbie, nobel prize barbie etc, she was just the basic barbie that everyone thinks is very basic. I am very basic person as well with mostly homemaking ambitions, and thats all.

When she broke down and said she s waiting for the more leadership orientated barbie to save the day, I felt so seen! lol smth I wonder how I can survive without my leadership orientated barbie in my life. But the movie teaches the nice lesson to be in control more as well.

my new mantra from now on is: I'm just Ken, and that's enough. And im great doing stuff. lol

169,"Huge stinker! Negative: Boring, bad pacing, terrible and nonsensical plot, cringe inducing pandering. The sequence where they enter the real world, get arrested with no repercussions, and then seemingly teleport all over LA was horrible. No world building or explaining why Barbie World exists, how and why the dolls and humans are able to travel between them. Will Ferrell and the evil white males were a total afterthought and a completely unnecessary story element. That chase scene in Mattel HQ was awful. The horribly insufferable daughter that wins the most slappable character this year. The ridiculously melodramatic ending that closes with a lame genital joke. Positive: Robbie and Gosling performances were good, and a few other standouts like Cera who deserved more character development. Overall I'm shocked not only that Mattel allowed the Barbie brand to be assassinated like this, but this was really the best they could come up with? Gerwig is more hype than substance, really not that talented.

170,"Overall enjoyed the movie. The first 30 minutes was solid and the transition into the second act was also a great time. Margot and Ryan truly stole the show. The set designs, the campy nature mixed with some emotional gravitas, MOST of the dialogue, choreography and songs, and the fun nature of Barbieland and their references to toy life.

My major con was that the messages near the end felt a bit too vindictive. I felt the first half of the story did a good job of conveying the struggles of a woman (the culture shock of the real world being male dominated in ways that were taken for granted, like the construction worker crew, and how Ken in reverse noticed men making decisions or in places of influence). Although Barbie had the clearest arc, I felt Ken had the most dynamic potential for character with the Kens being kind of purposeless and forgotten and sort of accessories to Barbie early in the movie, but by the end when the Barbies try to retake Barbieland it felt all that nuance was thrown away and men/Kens were simplified and denigrated and we sort of return to where we started at the beginning? The kens still don‚Äôt have a place, and although she emphasized ‚ÄúKen is you‚Äù, it was rather shallow and she did it in a way that was kind of harsh without any real compassion (after having just gone through that trauma herself). So idk. I felt the movie conveyed this idea that for women to feel safe/liberated/heard/valued that it‚Äôs a zero sum game with one gender needing predominant power, as opposed to building both up and learning to value the other strengths and weaknesses alike, empowering maleness and femaleness and how thag can build each other up.

Also I felt the finale was noticeably horribly paced compared to the first half. They attempted to rapidly resolve the teen girl/mom and it felt way too fast inorganic (with how nasty she was), the CEOs kind of got forgotten? (And really shouldn‚Äôt have even come to Barbieland as they added nothing), and they attempted to give Barbie like 3 different character resolutions. It just felt like too much and the movie really dragged and kept hammering the same points with TELLING as opposed to SHOWING by the end, which i felt the movie was doing very well in the beginning.",2023-07-21 19:35:37,66,movies,Malferon,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

175,"My take:  the long bits about gender roles were interesting but not the real plot. 

The real plot is ‚ÄúBarbie becomes fascinated by death and sets herself on the road to someday die‚Äù

She met an old woman, having never encountered aging/death, and thought: that‚Äôs beautiful. 

She met a ghost and said: make me like you. 

She made herself mortal when given the chance, so that someday she‚Äôd inevitably die. 

If we cut to Barbie three years from now in the real world, maybe she‚Äôll have a lotta skull tattoos, green and black hair, and a lip ring.

178,"I'm pretty surprised by how bad it was. Great sets, great costume design, but ultimately a very compromised and thematically incoherent film. Ryan Gosling may have been the best actor in the movie, but his acting was ultimately one-note.

I think there are elements of the movie that could have made for something great. The subtext of the opening homage to 2001 is that Barbie was not only a product of the sexual revolution, but someone who helped usher it in. Young girls (""moms"") are portrayed as playing with baby dolls, only to smash them when a giant Margot Robbie appears. Beautiful, sexy, and more free with her body, the scene efficiently communicates that the pill allowed Barbie to shape beauty standards, but also who women could aspire to be. The rub, of course, is that Barbie ended up reifying new patriarchal expectations of women. That the film ends with her saying, ""I'm here for my gynecologist,"" shows that the effect of women being able to control their reproductive health is on Gerwig's mind. The movie, unfortunately, is just not as interesting when it communicates its ideas through dialogue. It can't follow through with what it sets up in that opening minute.

I found that the movie's pivotal scene‚ÄîAmerica Ferrera's speech about the double standards women face‚Äîto be poorly acted and written, like a TikToker plagiarizing a Twitter thread that was published in those halcyon days when we thought Hilary Clinton would beat Donald Trump. It was cliched, unconvincing, and hollow, much like the dialogue between Ferrera and her daughter. My fianc√©e and I couldn't believe that Gerwig wrote such a false mother-daughter relationship, when *Lady Bird* opened with one of 2010s greatest scenes. We were also baffled by the film's resolution in Barbie Land.

Particularly with a trans actress like Hari Nef cast, one would think that Gerwig would be more interested in challenging gender roles. The happy ending in Barbie Land undercuts whatever she tried to say. Barbie Land as a matriarchy is of course supposed to make men reflect on how women can feel boxed in under a patriarchal system, but the film happily concludes with women having much more power than men, acting just as oppressive as men in the real world. Were the movie thematically coherent, if it actually had something to say beyond platitudes, it would show a world where men and women live in a society where things are equal. I don't know what that would look like, but it would be far more interesting to see what Gerwig thinks is possible in a movie with sets as fantastic as this, instead of one that is dully like our own.

I'm very disappointed in this movie, and Gerwig's future work makes me sad for the state of the industry. I'd much rather her make grounded, honest films like *Lady Bird*, with solid budgets, than ""subversive"" adaptations of corporate IP. *Barbie* today, Netflix's *The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe* tomorrow. It is a long march through movies that are marketed towards adults, but which have all the complexity of tossed off children's novels.",2023-07-21 05:18:39,61,movies,,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
179,"Let me know if I am overthinking. A lot of people are calling the movie as man hating, but I came out thinking it had a really good message. The Kens were all competing against each other, in this toxic struggle that I feel like a lot of men struggle with. Societal expectations often pushes men to want to be better than other men. It's like a constant struggle to need to get validation by competing against other guys. It seems men more often than women struggle with finding importance in their life and feeling valued. Part of that is feeling the need to find a beautiful woman to feel validation, that's something I felt as well. Then you have Barbie tell Ken he isn't defined by his girlfriend, he is defined by who he is. Same with the choreography dance of the ken battle. It was hilarious but at same time I feel like the message was obvious. There is no need to keep trying to compete against each other, be happy with who you are, and have a brotherhood akin to what a lot of women have in how they support each other.  
  
  
  
Yet I see the opposite take from a lot of guys. Am I misreading the movie or was that not the obvious theme in regards to the Kens?",2023-07-22 21:36:47,61,movies,ChesnaughtZ,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

181,"Honestly? I couldn‚Äôt stand it. 

My friends all liked it, and I thought the casting/costuming/set design was great. But I found the script TERRIBLE. The jokes felt tired, it felt like it was trying to be feminist but it almost felt patronizing and insulting to the audience‚Äôs intelligence. Yes, I know women can be doctors or moms. I know that patriarchy is bad. I know all of these things and the 3 minute monologue from the mom just felt redundant. Maybe if I was over 45 and unaware of most of the feminist ideology of the past 10 years, this would feel powerful and good, but I was just disappointed. 

I think I had high expectations so it just really fell flat for me.

I also don‚Äôt think that the way in which it alienated men was accurate or useful. There are a plentiful number of valid criticisms of the way that men operate around women, and it instead chose to be critical of things that I felt like were more like bullying than a constructive commentary or even fun. 
Additionally, to a male viewer that struggles with seeing women as people to begin with (there are so many teenage boys whose minds are currently being rotted by the likes of Andrew Tate), this does very little to offset the narrative that all women are evil and just view men as things to be used. 

The male characters were completely flat, and while I feel like this was partially intentional, it made the empowerment of women it was trying to perpetuate feel disingenuous because of how exaggerated and pathetic the male caricatures were. 

I think I also am coming from a place of empathizing with the incel basement dwellers we have all come to know and love. The problem is that they‚Äôre so disconnected from reality, and their perceptions of the modern women are almost completely analogous with the beginning of the movie relationship between Barbie and Ken. I just feel like that‚Äôs a narrative that desperately needs to be dispelled and I can easily see this film being used as fodder by the far right propaganda machines that This is Society now and women just want men to be an accessory.

I did enjoy Ryan gosling as ken, and Margot Robbie as Barbie, and generally thought the casting was done well. It had some very sweet moments, but overall I did not like it.

196,"I think that this is the first time a massive tentpole movie has been directed at adult women.  There are other very female movies like Legally Blonde and there are Disney Princess movies aimed at little girls, but this is the first event on par with superhero movies aimed at grown women.  Female driven comic book movies can be great, but they still come from a male world.  Barbie was created by a woman and her audience has generally been little girls.  The weird joy of seeing Barbie you played with as a child onscreen only exists for those who played with them.  I wasn't even super into Barbie as a kid, but I legit squealed seeing a few specific ones onscreen. 

Greta Gerwig is a woman who grew up in America and thus, inevitably played with Barbies.  That is how you get the very real Weird Barbie.  It is also how you get Barbie floating out of her house.  That is how girls play.  And no, no one thinks about where Ken lives or what he does when he is not squiring Barbie around.  Maybe young boys will become more drawn to Ken and he will develop his own less toxic masculine world, but as it stands now he is a supporting character.

Greta Gerwig is also a mother who made a whole movie about difficult teenage girls.  A lot of other filmmakers would have made the central human character Sasha, but Gloria is the central human here.  She's the one who calls Barbie to the real world and her struggles help the Barbies snap out of patriarchy.  Centering a woman rather than a girl really changes the tone of the movie.

Greta Gerwig is also an elder millennial and you get a lot of references to that with depression watching Pride and Prejudice and the Kens singing Matchbox Twenty at the Barbies.  

There is a critique of maleness here and I understand how that makes some guys uncomfortable.  But I genuinely laughed when they distracted Ken by asking him to explain The Godfather because that is a real thing!

It is not the be all end all of feminist representation.  It is simplistic in a lot of ways.  As /u/pinkpugita pointed out, it is easy for Barbie to choose the real world when that means being a beautiful, privileged woman instead of working in a sweatshop in the developing world.  The movie is very American.  But putting the word patriarchy at the center of a tentpole movie is still bold.",2023-07-24 02:40:33,56,movies,elinordash,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
197,"First half was good and had several funny moments, but they lost the plot in the second half.  Instead of focusing in on how neither the real world patriarchy or Barbieland matriarchy was ideal, but a compromise that respects everyone is better, they just kind of muddled through the ending with some long winded preaching.  

If the Mattel executive never appeared at the end it would have made no difference, but they where there and got a bunch of screen time for some reason.

Also, the final scene was a total let down.  Barbie joins the real world and isn't going for her first day of work or an interview but is proud to have real lady parts and go to a doctor, wtf?",2023-09-25 18:33:57,55,movies,AresStare,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

207,"
My second comment on the film now that the internet is still raging on about this movie and it's evilness or something.


The movie isn't anti-men or anti-women. It's anti modern day society's expectations for both and the message everyone should get from it is that being yourself is all you need to have value. 


Ken isn't being used as a prop to direct manhate on. His two arcs in chasing barbie's approval and then the Patriarchy are used to mock how ridiculous society's pressures on modern men are. Men are increasingly shamed and mocked for having no value if they are single these days and this movie addresses this in comedic fashion by mocking the ridiculous things they do and the lack of self-respect the Kens have for themselves in blindly chasing a woman for no apparent reason beyond it's their programming. And then the patriarchy stuff mocks the growing sentiment that men these days need to be more alpha and dominant by showing how utterly stupid it is in an entertaining manner. 


Similarly,the growing sentiment that women don't need men cuz girl power which ends up directing hate towards men is mocked with the oppressive matriarchy of Barbieworld. The ''heroes'' winning in the end doesn't feel remotely heroic cuz of how it's the exact same as the Kendom and only now decided to make some progress to reduce inequality. And the pressures Barbie faces in the movie first with her physical imperfections and then with uber progressive daughter mock other pressures women face nowadays. One that they need to look perfect at all times and the other that individual women have an unfeasible holy mission to solve the injustices and inequalities of the world or else they betray their sex. Former is mocked with the hilarious quip about how Margot Robbie isn't a good choice for talking about how ugly she is and the latter with the bit where the daughter blurts out that Barbie is a white saviour and calling her a fascist to show that people will never be satisfied and look to find hate and problems in anything. 


Both Ken and Barbie end the movie happy and with the discovery that just being themselves is what makes them happy. 


It's rare that we get a movie that gives positive messages for both guys and girls whilst tackling specific modern issues let alone a big and successful one which is also super fun like this one. People are too deadset in their ways by finding ways to be miserable and offended by this film which just shows that they are refusing to let go of their ideology in this weird cultural war that's waged today. People just need to have fun and be themselves!",2023-07-27 19:05:44,52,movies,mcm123456,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

209,"Okay, I finally saw Barbie after weeks of booked out cinemas in Australia. I'm really glad I did. 

- Firstly, I'm a *huge* Greta Gerwig fan, and while I don't think Barbie is her best movie, it certainly proves that she's a master of capturing and understanding the human condition. 

- I'm a guy, and I don't understand all the drama online about other men saying it's misandristic. The takeout for me, as a guy, was that men are raised in a world where we don't have to think twice about our place. Everything's set up for us to succeed. That leads a lot of men to follow what's expected of them, which can be unfulfilling and leave a lot of acting in a way that doesn't accord with our values. We don't have to do what's expected of a man - we can forge our own path. I found it empowering and reassuring, not offensive. 

- I really feel for Greta Gerwig, because it's clear her vision was somewhat neutered by Mattel. I get it, Barbie's one of the world's most protected brands, so there would've been some concessions to make the film happen. It definitely had no right being as good as it was, but it also felt like it was just missing that oomph to make it great. 

- I cried a lot more than I thought I would. It was really touching in parts. I really related to Alan, being the misfit kid who loved hanging with girls but was always lumped in with boys. I really liked that he felt like a nod to the ""in-between"" kids who never really felt like they fit anywhere. 

- People who say it was a weak ""girlboss"" version of feminism missed the point imo. It was supposed to be a love letter to women that acknowledges the whole of being a woman today. I don't think anybody expects Barbie to inspire a movement, but I think these messages and portrayals of women are important as a check on reality - particularly for young women who are still learning about it.",2023-08-26 10:57:50,52,movies,Gagginzola,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

212,"This movie had a bold choice near the end. Kens request for more justices is denied and he‚Äôs given a small crumb with male judges in the lower courts. It showed that there has been progress, but there are some shitty prevailing attitudes and behaviors towards Kens in Barbie land, just like with the patriarchy in the real world and how there is a lot of progress to be made but certain things are better. I bet it made a lot of people in the audience uncomfortable. Great move Greta Gerwig",2023-08-26 08:08:53,51,movies,04Aiden2020,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
213,"Comedy was pretty good and Ryan Gosling carried hard, however the message feels extremely confused here. The film very obviously tries to express topics such as feminism, patriarchy, power, and gender roles, however I feel like the way these themes are addressed is strange.

Ken somehow single handedly brainwashed everyone in Barbieland with some books, which created Ken's Kingdom, essentially the male mirror to Barbie land. The Barbies serve a similar role to what the Kens originally did. They seemed to be pretty happy with what was happening, but didn't seem to have free will, similar to the Kens in the original Barbie land.

Instead of the film actually exploring the issues in a patriarchy, it just boils the entire thing down to the Kens doing ""Manly stuff"" like having trucks horses and beers. It attempts to make a parallel to how things originally were when the Barbies were in charge and ""every night was girls night"", but now with Kens patriarchy ""every night is boys night"". However when the film concludes, instead of going for something equal at the end, they just opt to go back to the matriarchal version of Barbieland, with the Kens eventually getting more equal if the Barbies feel like it, ""Just like women in the real world""

Why do they even do this? The whole point of feminism is for women to be equal to men, not to create a female dominated society where the Kens are goofy muscleheads who can't do anything. If Barbie land is just the female version of Ken's kingdom then why does the show portray one as right and the other as wrong? Why not settle for something equal?  I know it is supposed to mirror real life and reverse the gender roles on feminism movements, but still I feel like this was unessesary.

My other issue was that the film very casually brushes over and glorifies what is essentially emotional manipulation. Like one of the main plans that happens is for the Barbies to lead one Ken on, then during an intimate moment start texting another Ken, to make them angry and to manipulate them to fight each other so they don't get to vote the next day. And the film fully endorses this and it's seen as a good thing to do. Yay, great lesson for the kids to learn.

Overall I liked the movie but I feel like it would have been better if it was less serious and calmed down on the social aspects. This whole movie feels like they started writing a script about Barbie entering the real world, but then they decided to add ""fuck the patriarchy"" in there as well, but they didn't implement it well at all.",2023-07-21 16:01:27,51,movies,agysykedyke,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

215,"Spoilers don‚Äôt read if you didn‚Äôt watch:

I feel like Ken‚Äôs point of view is so much deeper than just sidekick. I felt like it was supposed to represent how women felt prior to the feminist movement ‚Äî- never owning anything, feeling like your spouses accessory, no sense of identity and self worth outside of your partner and their accomplishments, making yourself seem perfect, the idea of your own gender pitting itself against each other for attention. There‚Äôs a reason Ken complains about not owning a Barbie dream house and says to Barbie he wanted it to be *their* house. Even the random dance number with Ken‚Äôs ‚Äî I can‚Äôt tell you how many classic 50‚Äôs films that have a random dance break with only women. 

Barbie land as a matriarchy was also extremely unfair. I felt the whole point of the movie is trying to find a more harmonious blend and balance for gender roles and also trying to give men an understanding of what it‚Äôs actually like for women. No wonder so many men hate Barbie land. Welcome to the real world lol.

Ken and the other Kens making a kendom really reminded me of 70s feminist movement. The Ken‚Äôs finally gain autonomy at the end (kind of like how the real world woman social revolution outcome) and the narrator makes it clear that barbie land is still matriarchal. That the Ken‚Äôs will have to work their way up/create change (like with the district court judge instead of Supreme Court judge statement). That‚Äôs where women are today in society ‚Äî still fighting for change.

The thing that gets me too is Ken‚Äôs doll plays on the already mass marketed and available toys for men prior to the feminist movement. The cowboy and boxer theme was everywhere. All little girls had were baby dolls ‚Äî boys had cowboy toys etc. boys could see themselves in anything. Ken in the patriarchal world can see himself in anything and any job he wants. That‚Äôs trying to explain to the viewer that Barbie land is so important for younger girls because they can see themselves as having limitless potential. 

Barbie isn‚Äôt about hating men ‚Äî- it‚Äôs about recognizing that she was a huge cultural shift where little girls suddenly had a toy that showed they could be anything. Barbie owned her own things before many women could get their own credit card.

It‚Äôs actually incredible how a lot of men just don‚Äôt understand this movie. And it‚Äôs disappointing because I felt like Ken might have drove the point home. 

My grandmother couldn‚Äôt have a credit card or property for most of her life ‚Äî and she was addressed as her husbands name. we are not as far removed from serious systemic sexism that people like to think we are. We clearly still live in a patriarchal society and some women have to bust their ass to get to where they want to be ‚Äî but they do it to help the girls after them.",2023-07-23 17:48:36,51,movies,throwaway37865,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

219,"Okay, so everyone and their mother has thoughts on Barbie, so instead of talking about how awesome of a movie it is generally, I want to focus on this notion that it's ""anti-men"".

Sure, they definitely poke fun at masculine stereotypes but lest we forget the ENTIRE MOVIE also calls out the impossible feminine standards set by Barbie herself. It is dissecting the very concept of gender and its implications on society. Men are in a constant war to dominate each other, while women are being held to extreme standards set by both men AND other women. It's a hyperbolic and satirical take on gender conflict.

But the end has perhaps one of the best ""be yourself"" lessons ever, because both Barbie and Ken realize they're more than the roles set out for them. They manage to find purpose and agency where before they were just acting out a play.

Barbie is a person. 

Ken is Kenough.

Being yourself matters more than whatever society thinks of you.

220,"I was rather disappointed. I had higher expectations. It did not live up to its potential with that cast. It wasn't nearly funny enough. Ryan Gosling overshadowed Margot Robbie, who to be honest was the only reason I went to see it. 

I think it went in and out of the double entendres and side humor too frequently. It couldn't decide what it wanted to be. I had hoped that it would be more like the '90's Brady Bunch movie, which was near perfection. It needed to be both lighter and darker.

I think the feminist awakening and the male backlash were both a little too heavy. I think it was a worthy issue and perspective to take head on, but if they had kept it lighter, the potential for humor would have been much greater.

In one other area, I'd like to compare it with the Ghostbusters reboot, which was a much better movie than its detractors maligned it as. The female perspective was fine; the problem was they were completely outclassed by Chris Hemsworth, who owned every scene he was in. Similarly, Ryan completely outshone Margot in this one, and it became the Ken Movie. Margot needed to be let loose. She need to bring a bit of Harley and a bit of evil into the role.

Those are my main thoughts; sorry my writing and expression aren't better as I have difficult writing on mobile. I'd give it 2 stars out of 4.",2023-07-21 13:49:40,50,movies,JBHills,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

226,"Barbieland is our girlhood ‚Äî when we are naive about the world and honestly believe we can be ‚Äúwhatever we want to be.‚Äù  Many girls are zapped into the ‚ÄúReal World‚Äù when we encounter the male gaze as soon as we approach puberty.  I was 12 when I started getting harassed by grown men at the bus stop.  Yes, violent threats were commonplace. 

Barbieland *is* a matriarchy, but the Kens are not objectified, nor pushed into servitude ‚Äî they just coexist with the Barbies but are still accessories to the Barbies with no real agency or identity of their own. 

Transitioning to the Real World is like the coming of age for many girls (and boys). Barbie instantly feels objectified with ‚Äúan undercurrent of violence‚Äù but Ken is discovering he, simply for being a man, is at the top of the power pyramid. 

When Ken comes back, he institutes a learned patriarchy in a zero sum manner. It‚Äôs not enough to just run off with the Kens and start their own society, but they do so at the expense of the Barbies. They take their homes, their cars, and push them into a hierarchical servitude. 

When Barbie comes back and teams up with the other Barbies to correct the patriarchy, she implores Ken to find meaning as Ken, not just as an accessory to Barbie. She acknowledges the matriarchy wasn‚Äôt fair either.  She wants him to live out his own purpose, to have agency ‚Äî even after everything he did.  Ken isn‚Äôt evil, and the Barbies aren‚Äôt man-haters but the Kens fell victim to patriarchy too as men. 

When Ruth, Barbie‚Äôs mom, takes Barbie‚Äôs hand and walks off to have a private conversation with her, this scene to me symbolizes the special relationship mothers can have with their daughters. 

We as mothers know the hurt that is our society and how it treats women, especially women who haven‚Äôt been ‚Äúbroken‚Äù by the patriarchy yet ‚Äî but we cannot bear ourselves to be *complete* cynics to our young daughters. We do not abandon the idea of the utopia in the hopes that one day our daughters way down the line might finally reap the seeds we have been planting for millennia. 

The montage of women at the end, represent the countless women who have come before us, bore the even harsher, base realities of patriarchy, yet still, collectively, have kept the sisterhood alive. 

The very last scene is made to be like typical close out scenes ‚Äî aspirational and gearing you up for a real feel good ending. 

Barbie chose to live in the Real World, despite a guaranteed troubled existence. She chose to ‚Äúhave ideas‚Äù and make a difference rather than continue living life as an object. Many women have this radicalizing moment themselves in their own lives ‚Äî dare I say, when we get ‚Äúwoke‚Äù to patriarchy and the stupid fucking glass ceiling. 

She becomes the ordinary woman, heading to her gynecologist appointment ‚Äî a completely mundane activity.

I thought that it was actually quite nuanced on the take on Ken, and their entire relationship was really interesting to me. Loved the scene where he told her it was his house as a mirror of what she'd said earlier. Loved her not knowing where the Kens lived. Loved her apologizing to him for treating him like an accessory and gently pointing out that he can figure out what he wants to be without the external validation of a woman.

The message of empowering women was SO INCREDIBLY on the nose and preachy that I started to think it was a satire of a satire. Perhaps I gave Gerwig and Baumbach too much credit because even when analyzed two levels deep the message is still so unclear and confusing.

Gerwig has already written incredibly personal stories that place the viewers into the characters shoes before. Barbie feels so much more distant compared to characters from *Lady Bird* and *Little Women.* This film has way too much telling, and no showing.

The things I did like were:  
  
The designs. It was absolutely amazing how they were able to replicate the Barbie Dreamhouse. The costume design is great, and it really felt like the dolls came to life.  
  
The acting was phenomenal. Especially Margot Robbie's and Ryan Gosling's. Personally, Gosling's Ken really carried the movie in my eyes, not to discredit Robbie as her acting was equally as impressive and I really felt the scenes where Barbie was experiencing true emotions for the first time.  
  
As a cinephile the movies references were a nice touch. Not in a way that said ""we're cultured we have movie references"" but it actually added to the plot. The 2001 Space Odyssey reference said that Barbie evolved toys the same way the monoliths evolved the monkeys and the humans.  
  
The appearance of the actual Barbera was a nice edition.  
  
When Ruth said ' I created Barbie so all my daughters could look back and see how far we've come' I felt that. It was only a sentence, but it was so powerful. My theater didn't give a big reaction to it, but it didn't need one. It was powerful enough on its own.  
  
Ken's character arc was really well done. Learning that he is 'kenough' and doesn't need a woman's validation and to just be himself was nice. His journey of self-discovery was nice to watch.  
  
The songs were great in the movie. I'm personally not a fan of Ice Spice, but I legitimately think the Barbie World remix was good.  
  
Alan was comedy gold in the movie. Even though it was random I loved the fight scene between him and the Kens.  
  
The cartoony physics made the movie more lighthearted.  
  
But there are some things that I didn't like about the movie:  
  
The Mattel board consisting of all men was weird considering since half of the Mattel board is women, and the head of Barbie has always been a woman. To people who don't bother researching about Mattel it just makes them look bad.  
  
America's speech I thought was pretty good. 'You have to be bossy, but not too bossy otherwise you come off as rude'. She made a lot of points and all of them were valid. You could feel frustration through the screen. I thought it was missed opportunity to not bring up so much of the male frustration. I know it's a 'Barbie' movie, but half the movie was about Ken, so I think they should've talked about it a bit more. A lot of men are confused and lost. It's a reason why influencers like Andrew Tate are so famous right now. They have the ability to take control of vulnerable men and warp their viewpoints. I think if they talked about male frustration a little more it could create an interesting conversation.  
  
As much as the movie loves to talk about the patriarchy, they never say anything about Barbieland being a matriarchy. They call out all the toxic men in the real world, which they should. Sexual harassment and inequality are topics that should be taken seriously and shouldn't be ignored. But they kind off brush off mistreating the Kens. The Kens have no houses, no jobs, are given no real personality outside of being attractive, and their happiness depends on if the Barbie's engage in conversation with them. At the end Barbie just says 'sorry for ignoring you' but things basically go back to how they were. You would think after all the things the Barbies and Kens went through, they would reject both the patriarchy and matriarchy and embrace a new system that benefits the both of them.  
  
The concept that the Barbie's were brainwashed and needed to be 'deprogramed' felt wrong. Because there is nothing wrong with being a traditional girlfriend, or a housewife, or a stay-at-home mom. It can be legitimately difficult and there's nothing wrong with having those types of traditional relationships as long as they're not abusive or toxic. Feminism should be about respecting women as individual beings who have their own aspirations and dreams. If a woman dreams about being a housewife, why not let them be one?  
  
It felt really wrong that it was encouraged to emotionally manipulate and gaslight the Kens and it was treated as something powerful.  
  
I understand that Ken wouldn't be the type of person to have social anxiety, but to say no man has social anxiety? Really?  
  
And there were some things in the movie that were just a straight up missed opportunity. Like when America's daughter talked about how Barbie gives girls poor body image, I was actually waiting for it to be brought up later. Because in 2016 a study was conducted that said girls (ages 6-8) were dissatisfied with their own bodies after just 5 minutes of playing with a Barbie doll. And another study which is now famous, black children were brought into a room. They were told to choose with doll they preferred between a white and a black doll. All of the kids said they preferred the white doll, because it 'looked more like them' and the black dolls were 'bad'. I think this shows that things like toys and television can impact the way children perceive beauty. I thought the movie would be this up later and say 'hey you don't have to look like Barbie, but we can aspire to be just as hardworking as Barbie' - but it was just used as a throwaway line in roasting session.  
  
I saw someone on the internet describe 'Barbie' this way and I have to agree. They said it 'felt like brainstorming turned into a movie'. The movie kind of felt half baked, and I feel like all it has done is perpetuate a gender debate on the internet instead of a conversation. Men and women both struggle, just in different areas of life. Women are more likely to be sexually harassed and discredited, and men are more likely to deal with depression and suicidal thoughts. Instead of competing with each other about who has it harder, we should be open to talking about these issues without antagonizing the other sex. That's how our problems will be solved.  
  
Again, I want to state that I liked 'Barbie'. It was a fun movie and nice change of pace from what general audiences typically watch. If you disagree with anything I said, I would love to hear what you have to say - because as I said earlier, I feel like it's important to have conversations about these types of things.

242,"I personally didn‚Äôt like it. I‚Äôm a woman who grew up with Barbie and I was disappointed. 

At the beginning of the movie I thought it was super fun and interesting the set and world was great. While I loved seeing Barbie and the world but as a character I actually immediately related to Ken. Especially when they went to the real world and someone asked him the time and he was so happy to be seen as important enough to be asked what time it is. I had a moment where my teacher asked me to help him move some boxes with some other students. Usually they always ask the guys but I‚Äôm being treated the same. I know it‚Äôs small but when you‚Äôre treated less than based on your gender it‚Äôs important to you. 

So I knew that Ken would go overboard and that hopefully the message would be no one should be treated as less than to make the other persons life better and that Kens and Barbie‚Äôs would both be happy but that‚Äôs not what happened. 

Kens moment where he cries that he is nothing without Barbie is seen for laughs which makes me sad. I‚Äôve seen so many women be raised with that idea and be so lost with themselves when they realize they don‚Äôt need to think and act that way. That making it for a joke just because it‚Äôs a male character upset me. 

I also had a problem with the negatives of Barbie being said in a small speech but then they never really explained it resolved in any way. They just shifted the focus to stopping the Kens without acknowledging hey yeah Barbie can have flaws and be negative to women too. 

I loved that they tried to explain the patriarchy I have no problem with social commentary or political stuff in movies and I‚Äôm all for explaining how women are put down but this movie kind of ruins it‚Äôs own points with the way they treat the Kens. 

Especially at the end when they ask to have at least one spot on the Supreme Court and the president says no they can have a smaller less important role. Then the narrator says the kens would ‚Äúfigure it out‚Äù and would eventually get more power but just enough that women have in the real world. The way it‚Äôs said implies kens deserve less power because they‚Äôre incompetent which is a point men have been saying about women for ages‚Ä¶ just because it‚Äôs said about men does not make the point less sexist or wrong. Your gender has nothing to do with how you handle power and being a leader. This also implies that for women in the real world it never gets better for them.

There are also other smaller things politically I thought could be handled better as well as general movie things such as pacing and some characters being useless but that was my main issue with the movie. I really wanted to like it more than I did since I love Barbie and grew up with it but I was disappointed.",2023-07-22 07:48:53,45,movies,Desperate-Advisor177,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
243,"I loved Barbie. I think it's getting oversimplified into something ""anti-man."" I don't think it was at all. 

It was unapologetically feminist but it ripped into inequality both ways. People are empathizing with Ken and that's intentional. They wouldn't have made him sympathetic if that wasn't the point. 

Not to mention the inclusion of Allan at all was there to illustrate not all men subscribe to patriarchal views.

Did it spend a lot of time ribbing patriarchal structures? 100%. Did it also point out that matriarchy is hypocritical and misandry isn't the answer? Yes. Pretty overtly.",2023-07-26 03:10:35,45,movies,brittanydiesattheend,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

252,"It really makes me sad to say but I genuinely disliked this movie. 


Yes, it does have positives. Margot and Ryan were well cast, sets are good, some jokes were funny, etc.


However, here are some issues I had:

* The movie pretends to be smarter than it is while actively contradicting itself. Margot's Barbie has an existential crisis because she feels she is not beautiful or smart. She feels average because she isn't an astronaut, doctor, etc. But she learns it's ok if she's not because she's herself. Stereotypical Barbie is just a normal Barbie. Then, what idea does Farerra pitch at the very end that is so great that Farrell hates until he learns it'll be profitable? Average Barbie. The thing that exists and we spent a whole movie on: Stereotypical Barbie. She's not an astronaut or a President. She's just Barbie. She is a blank canvas for kids' imaginations. Basically, what Farrera had: a doll that reflected her turmoil. Farrera didn't need Depression Barbie or any specifically targeted one. She just projects onto the Barbie she has, which is what kids do. So, why is it presented as some genius idea that she just came up with? It already exists. I think they have a line about having the Barbie look average, after having a whole speech about women being criticized for their appearances (with diverse Barbies everywhere). Are they suggesting there is one standard of avergae? Is a Barbie that looks like Margot not average? How can you ask for an average Barbie while also trying to argue there should be no standard?

* The movie starts with Margot questioning death. This is not resolved. Ruth (a ghost, which actively contradicts this fear) shows Barbie what the world is like, but despite Ruth saying she wants Barbie to see reality, every single image she is presented is a positive. At no point does Barbie confront her mortality yet she chooses to be human. She also has no reason to live in the real world. She constantly mentions how uncomfortable she felt there. She enjoys the emotions that come with being human but she has those now whether she lives in Barbieland or not. Why would she actively choose a world that makes her feel ill at ease rather than stay in Barbieland where others are changing and she has friends. Ken now has emotions, and the Barbies are becoming more aware, so why leave?

* Barbie sees a woman on a bench who is old and immediately calls her beautiful. This is before she even starts on her journey of selfdiscovery. She has a breakdown later of not being beautiful despite seeing that beauty is not what she perceived it to be. This is completely done out of order. Why does a Barbie who screams at seeing cellulite just minutes before, see an old woman and just call her beautiful? Why was this not a scene later in the movie, when she comes back into the real world and has a new perspective on beauty standards? It makes no sense within that point in the story.

* Ken goes into the real world and learns about ""patriarchy"" but sees that the real world doesn't actually work like that. Kens have no jobs or positions of power in Barbieland, but women have jobs in the real world. He runs into a doctor, but he arbitrarily asks to see the real doctor (ie a man) because he just learned of patriarchy, despite having lived a life where women are doctors. He goes around and asks to do surgery but learns that he can't do that just because he's a man, he needs credentials. So, how is he still believing in patriarchy and trying to push it in Barbieland when most of what he has experienced condradicts it? 

* Ken is so inconsistent. He wants Barbie's approval but ditches her in the real world for patriarchy.

* The morality is off and the message isn't about creating a more unified equal world. When the movie started, I thought it was going to have some great parallels, especially when Ken calls out the inequality Kens face in Barbieland. They don't have homes, don't have any power, and don't get respect. He is filled with joy just by the someone asking him the time. That is a result of how Barbies have made Kens feel. Then Barbie goes to the real world and sees how life can be unfair. When they get back, Ken kicks her out of the house and says something along of the lines of, doesn't feel good, does it? Lesson learned, right? Nope. Barbie apologizes to Ken, but it still ends with them not wanting to give the Kens anything other than the bare minimum. The Kens ask for one position on the supreme court so they feel represented and are turned down and offered a lower position and told that they might get it some day. Why? Why is the message to be vindictive and exclusionary, rather than empathetic and collaborative. So, no lesson was learned from anything. This doesn't even reflect the real world where we have both men and women on the supreme court. If the argument is that well women weren't allowed to for a long time, does that somehow justifies these Barbies' actions? The message is power and revenge, versus working together towards a better future. It's also revenge in a world where the Kens, until this recent uprising (as a result of how they were treated), had done nothing to deserve being treated this way. The Barbies (except Margot) are acting on knowledge of a real world they have never experienced. They only know a world where they hold 100% of the power and Kens are accessories. Once again, Ken calls this out when he says to Barbie that it doesn't feel good being treated like a Ken, does it? The Kens are told to be themselves at the end but are not actually given anything in the world. Weird Barbie is offered a cabinet position with the President as a whoops, sorry we bullied you, but not a single Ken is offered a position of power. Once again, it seems morally wrong to have that be the conclusion of the movie. Shouldn't we be moving past these us versus them ideas? 

* The speech Farrera makes is so ham fisted. The Barbies in that world have no frame of reference for what she's talking about. They live in a world they control and where everything is perfect. Why is their brainwashing (never explained by the way) broken by her speech? They have never experienced those things. Also, Farerra makes comments about how women are constantly judged for their interests, looks, and actions. Yet, shortly after, the movie mocks the Kens for having passions such as wanting to talk about the Godfather or music. Her speech mentions womens weights and not having one standard. Yet, later, she proposes an average Barbie. The movie makers did not know what their message was and it shows.

* There is no consistentcy in how the movie is visually told. The Barbies are inconsistent in when they act like dolls and when they act like people. They walk on tip toe but they wave like people. Margot stops acting like a doll, except when she falls over in that one scene. The cars flip and we get a 2D dust cloud but we don't get that same artistic style when Ken gets pushed back by the wave, or any other moment of impact. Every scene seems individualized with no overarching stylistic connections or vision. Compare this something like the Matrix where Agent Smith and the other agents always have stiff and robotic movements. You notice it in the way they run, turn their heads, nod, etc. This movies picks and chooses based on what they need from the scene versus building a world that is consistent.

* Farrera is a good artist but it doesn't matter. The daughter doesn't like her mom because ...teenage angst? They both just make up with no actual conversation, other than the daughter saying her mom isn't a terrible artist. Farrera's husband speaks Spanish to Margot for some reason. Yeah, he was practicing it, but why would he say it to Margot? Why can't he just be a normal guy?

* I remember this being an issue when the movie Us came out, but I find it to be the same issue in this: the one-to-one between the two worlds is not explained and makes no sense. There appear to be no repeat Barbies in Barbieland. So, is Margot's Barbie specifically linked to Farrera, or every child that owns a Stereotypical Barbie? Because if it's the latter, are we to believe that only one Barbie in the history of Barbies (Kate McKinnon) has been played with so hard that she became weird? They mention others breaking in passing but never mention what happens to them. Also, Margot's Barbie ""breaks"" because Farrera is sad her daughter doesn't like her and she's having an existential crisis. So, kids playing with Barbies as they experience grief, loss, anxities, etc. just have had no effect, especially when one Barbie there reflects thousands of kids, except once? 

* Presenting consumerism as funny. They wanted Barbie's realization to come from Ruth Handler so bad that they wrote off Handler committing tax fraud as a joke. If this was Walt Disney, people would be lambasting it for the sheer corporate white-washing. That wouldn't be unwarranted so why does Handler get a pass? Barbie even takes her last name as her own at the end. It makes sense to honor the creator but also doesn't seem right to present a corporate felon as Barbie's guiding angel. Also, the WB Discovery building is predominately displayed behind the Mattel building. Then, Farrera is driving a brand new Chevy and also every car chasing her is a Chevy. That scene was practically a car commercial. And there are numerous people in this thread alone wanting a ""I am Kenough"" sweater. This movie is not breaking down consumerism, but perpetuating it. This is not a, well what did you expect from a movie about Barbie? thing. That would be fine if they didn't have whole scenes in the movie to paint it as some critical breakdown of consumer/corporate culture, ie the scene where Barbie first meets Farrera's daughter. Every negative comment about that is met with well Mattel probably made them do that, but any positive is met with Greta is a genius.

262,"Unironically a masterpiece. The message of the movie (leitmotiv) is immaculate and on point. Its such a refreshing and positive message in an age where the ""us vs them"" mentality is running rampant all over the world and everyone and their mothers can feel pressured to be or act a certain way to get those likes, reactions or positive comments.

Mattel made a LOT of BOLD moves on this one. From being the villains themselves, to the way they presented Barbie and her existencial crisis, to the way they developed Ken, to even the actual ending where they don't end up together and Barbz ends up becoming human. There were a LOT of ballsy decisions taken and I applaud every single one of them. It was so refreshing to see a company be this self aware, playful and being able to poke fun at itself. I've been in advertising meetings and I can tell ya, this is NOT an easy pitch lmao. Kudos to whoever made the decisions or convinced others to accept this tone.

Margot Robbie is iconic. I really think this could get an Oscar shout and Ryan Gosling was no slouch either. It felt like every performance, every scene played out EXACTLY as it should. The director should also be commended. Fuck it, everyone should! The dance numbers, the different sets and settings, the colors, the costumes, the different types of humor they used, the performances, the soundtrack and even the deeper message of it all hit just the right spot.

Its not often I finish watching a movie and think ""10/10. Not a single point taken."", but this was it LMAO. I did NOT expect a Barbie movie to hit the way this did. Iconic, fun and with an incredible message that's extremely relevant to current times.

263,"As soon as I walked out of the theatre, I realized just how much the movie surprised me. It was meta and comedic, but without removing its multi-faceted messages. It was also eye-opening. As a young man, it may seem quite stupid but the movie made me question a lot of my double standards and presented a worldview of healthy relationships, empowerment, and true independence. I think what sets this movie apart from the most obvious wokeism cash grabs is that it stays true to its themes and finds ways to present them masterfully. It doesn't take itself seriously but knows it's saying things that people need to hear so it doesn't drown them out. I feel genuinely enlightened by my experience, and the messages the movie leveled toward its male audience were powerfully mature. This movie is simply strange to me.

The movie explains how men and women are treated differently in society, how women have to fight to be taken seriously, and how hurtful toxic masculinity and toxic femininity are.

The moral of the movie is that everything has to have a balance. Barbie had an existential crisis and I, too, had it. This movie inspired me to get out there and chase my dreams.",2023-10-20 01:18:57,42,movies,benderlax,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
267,"THERE WAS JUST TOO MUCH KEN. TOO MUCH KEN AND TOO MANY CONFLICTING IDEAS.

The movie opened up a lot of ideas to explore--- Feminism, Body image, Misogyny, Sexism, the Patriarchy, Mother/Daughter relationships, Capitalism, Corrupt Justice System, etc.   
  
And ALL OF THOSE got completely erased because of KEN.  
  
So Ken had basically gone back to Barbieland to turn it into Kendom because he really really liked the patriarchy. The movie showed this also in a comedic way, and made it seem like the patriarchy was something so silly. The patriarchy was just men being shirtless, fur jackets, and beers. In fact, the patriarchy was actually THE WOMEN'S FAULT, because none of this would have happened if Barbie didn't have ""girls night"" every night!!! So suck on that Barbie, because guess what? All the other Barbies are happy that they don't have to think and just massage the Ken's feet.  
  
Now I understand that all the Barbies were like.... brainwashed or something? But they didn't even explain that well and made it seem like women LIKED being part of the patriarchy unless someone snapped them out from it. That's untrue. No women likes the patriarchy and we're perfectly aware that it's happening.  
  
Anyways, you at least expect Barbie to step up and save everyone BUT NO, she begins to cry about how she's ugly??? And just lies down and does nothing??? I was really confused as to why Barbie kept saying that she was ugly???  
  
And its not until Sasha's mom gives the ""girl-power speech"" for Barbie to snap out from it. But the ""girl-power speech"" is literally something from an instagram post. It's copy pasted from old tumblr. It was all ""Women have to be skinny but not too skinny"" like... yes, that's true, but also you're really reducing everything into this sappy speech of what a middle schooler realizes. If you remember Greta Gerwig's Little Women, the speech that Jo does near the end of the movie is much more in depth and explains a lot-- while the ""girl-power speech"" was barely even making a statement.  
  
And somehow that speech saves all the Barbies. And then they hatch a plan to distract the Kens--- and do so by completely grabbing all the stereotypes of what a women is versus what a man is and squeeze it into 10 minutes. It was all very just ""femininity belongs to women and masculinity belongs to men! Haha!"" Like in 2023? Come on.  
  
Anyways, Barbie gets Barbieland back and Ken begins to sulk. He starts saying that he lost interest in the patriarchy when it wasn't about horses, and that he just didn't know who he was if he wasn't part of Barbie, all that jazz. I have a lot to say about this scene specifically.  
  
First, WHAT THE HELL? It was just 5-10 minutes of Ken crying, and Barbie having to calm him down by saying ""Oh Ken, we know you started this patriarchy thing because I dismissed you. It's not your fault. You can cry now. We understand."" Like NO, because A) Ken knew what the patriarchy was about, he didn't do it for the horses, he did it because he wanted power over Barbie. and B) MEN BEING REJECTED IS NOT THE SAME AS WOMEN BEING OPPRESSED AND HARRASED EVERYDAY!!! FRAGILE MASCULINITY IS NOT COMPARABLE TO THE PATRIARCHY!  
  
Barbie had a line where she said ""I think I owe you an apology."" I was like... why? I thought maybe Barbie was going to apologize for leading Ken on because it was obvious that she didn't like Ken in a romantic way--- she literally said ""I don't like Ken the same way he likes me"". But then she started apologizing for having girls night and not appreciating him enough? What? If a man starts the patriarchy, are we to blame his girlfriend for not paying attention to him?  
  
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS WHOLE SCENE AT ALL? I'm still confused on why Ken was so angry enough to oppress the entire Barbies in Barbieland, I'm confused why Barbie had 0 character arc and was apologizing to Ken, and I'm confused why Ken didn't even learn anything after that. He didn't apologize for doing anything-- he just threw his jacket away and went down the slide while being like ""I'm Ken!!!"" like we know, get out of the screen.  
  
and Finally, the ending... you expect everything to get resolved, but it doesn't. The male CEO of MATTEL continues to make money off of women and also contributes to capitalism by making an ""Ordinary Barbie"". The patriarchy in the real world was not affected/changed whatsoever. Sasha and her mom is magically best friends now. Everyone forgives each other. No one likes Pregnant Midge. And cellulites are ugly.  
  
But then Barbie, for some reason, wants to become human??? And I thought, okay, maybe Barbie wants to go back to the real world because she managed to defeat the patriarchy in her world, so maybe she's becoming an activist Barbie or a feminist Barbie! And then it just cut to another joke, haha, and the movie ended.  
  
I think the movie had a lot of potential, and it actually brought up a lot of subjects to the table--- but managed to end it without a proper resolution. If you asked me what the sole message of that movie was, I couldn't tell you. At this point it's fragile masculinity! I thought the movie would be more about Barbie, not Ken. That motherfucker got a whole song and dance break. Barbie didn't even get that. I mean at the beginning there was a party scene, but even then it was focused on how Ken wanted her attention. It was just all about Ken.  
  
I don't know--- I probably expected a bit too much from a movie from a multi-billion dollar brand that's trying to promote Barbie dolls. I should probably just be grateful that there were some golden moment near the beginning.",2023-07-22 21:25:36,42,movies,Iamliterally18iswear,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

269,"What made the whole story click together for me

I loved the movie on the first watch because of all the on-the-nose validating moments, on the second I wanted to understand all the intentional elements. Like many people I saw the individual pieces but couldn't make sense of the whole picture, it took half the walk home to get to where I am now. I empathize with some comments saying things felt too spelled out and disjointed. What ended up pulling it together for me was what Will Ferrell's character emphasised, that Barbieland at its core is what fuels the hopes and dreams of young girls. It isn't a reflection of a better world or a world run by women, just a young girl's internal world, like many of ours', spearheaded by Barbie.

Something I battled with was why was it ok the Barbies to overthrow Kens back for a system that favors one side way more when that's theoretically just the problem of patriarchy in reverse. But it makes sense with Barbieland being the home of young girls' minds and dreams needing to be maintained. Waking the Barbies from ""brainwashing"" supported young girls' dreams centering their personal missions, not their kens'. It made the touch of maid outfits so appropriate.

And when the Kens took over, it was only a manly surface decoration over the pink dream houses. It was a girl's internal world smothered by the image of men, it isn‚Äôt foundationally a boy's world or neutral land. It‚Äôs stolen land which is why the barbies were justified in taking it back, hence the smallpox reference. The Barbies taking back Barbieland wasn't for just their own comfort, but to defend the real world girls' self-image feuled by Mattel‚Äôs toys. The established Barbie image is far from perfect as the movie insinuates, but it was definitely essential that the ideas of powerful girly women not be completely eradicated by romantisised patriarchy in the world of young girls.

Ken‚Äôs version of patriarchy looked so goofy and couldnt work in the real world because it's what a girl‚Äôs mind thinks having patriarchy work for them looks like. The idea that an easy romantic life waits for girls if they're dumber, skimpier, obedient, and following confident cowboy men. The Kens and Barbies both lived so absurdly happy in either version because Barbieland is founded on young girls imagining their lives as harmoniously perfect. The tempting ideas of patriarchy can fit right into that. The issue as a whole only started to break down with the exposure and acceptance of being sad, weird, and imperfect via Barbie's journey, outcast Barbies, and the humans. Patriarchy was just another vessel for Barbieland to see the flaws of blindly following perfection, triggered by the point of monologue. It starts the whole discussion for change and acknowledges the flaws of barbieland including treatment of ken and other babies.

Oh and Kens turn on Barbie really is really a show of how our perception of men when we are young can betray us once we go into the real world.

This was an adhd barf. Hope people can relate to this, it's how everything from the movie came together for me. These were some of my connections, but after reframing it in this way made many small details fall into place and now I think this story is incredibly well thought out and is a personal love of mine.

In hindsight, Brabieland being the materialization of girlhood was constantly iterated by how Barbie was linked to Gloria, the toys changing in the real world, and Will Ferrell's obsession with keeping the balance, but I guess that just didn't click for me as I was watching. It made sense of why the Kens were as nonessencial as they were, why they had to lose their power, the role of Gloria and the outcasts, and why Babrieland had to change in the end. Now I really get all those saying ‚Äúit isn't for you‚Äù, because it only tackles men through the perspective of vulnerable fantasy girlhood. In fact it barely addresses real world men, and the fleeting moments that do are quite humanising.",2023-08-06 04:09:22,42,movies,Secret_Storm585,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
270,"The Barbie movie really blew away my expectations from the start. I knew there would be darker and lighter themes, but the trailers and initial parts of the film made it seem like it would be about Barbie, the perfect fantasy superheroine-of-femininity helping a struggling girl with her problems, but the movie then does a 180 turnaround and says ""screw that!"" and focuses on the two normal humans helping Barbie with her problems!   
  
Barbie's ultra-feminist matriarcal utopia ideal is torn down harder than the baby dolls were satirically at the start of the movie where they declared ""and then gender role problems were SOLVED FOREVER! Yay!"" in a move that brought to mind that infamous ""Pepsi is the solution to all conflict"" commercial.   
  
Firstly by reality, where it's harshly criticized that her impossible standards feel like just another way society pressures women to meet expectations that cannot be met.   
  
But then also by Ken, who we see has his feelings dismissed as unimportant and who doesn't know how to have self-confidence without tying it to someone else. He's surprisingly interesting to me in how he's framed as the antagonist, but you can clearly see he's just someone who felt rejected and disrespected and unimportant, only to find all these books in the ""Real World"" about Patriarchy, and how if you just DO THAT, you'll get all the respect and importance and women you could ever desire.   
  
So he does, turning Barbie Land into dudebro land and flipping the entire hierarchy upside-down. The Barbies fighting to take things back by underhanded emotional manipulation of their fragile masculinity.   
  
It works, but the scene after is WHY it works. Yes, we've played with the idea of Barbie and deconstructing its interaction with gender roles with all the subtlety of a plastic hammer, but what's the RESOLUTION? Ken is crying on Barbie's bed, venting to her about how he felt disrespected, unappreciated, and felt the need to constantly fight for her attention because he didn't know who he was without her. And she listens, and apologizes for how she made him feel.   
  
Because this movie isn't about a plastic perfect personification of feminism going to the real world and fixing a depressed woman's body issues. This movie isn't about Barbie and her fellow girlbosses overthrowing the Patriarchy and restoring Barbieland to ""How it's supposed to be.""  
  
It's a movie about people who feel disrespected and underappreciated. About people who see ideas about ""who they should be"" and try to cram themselves into that mold because then they will get the love or attention or respect they crave more than anything in the world. It's not about trying to be perfect, but recognizing that we can be better. Not with hair extensions or makeup, or working out and acting macho, but with telling someone ""you look nice today"" or ""your feelings are valid."" Being there for each other but also for ourselves.",2023-07-26 18:40:20,42,movies,Periwinkleditor,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
271,"I've seen lots written on the film about hyperreality, simulacrum etc (they even make a Matrix joke on the subject) but has anyone considered the movie as a sort of modern, inverse, morality play? The inciting action for the whole film is not about equality or gender but about death which ultimately sends her on this pilgrimage. She goes from a paradise, it turns to hell, she restores it to paradise, but ultimately chooses mortality after encountering her creator and choosing a life of pain and suffering so she can grow. She doesn't even have a name, she's literally an ""everywoman."" Before seeing it yesterday, I would have never thought to ask whether Pilgrim's Progress was an inspiration for a Barbie movie but here we are.",2023-08-30 17:48:43,41,movies,OzArdvark,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
272,"The movie was visually dazzling, lots of fun, and had a lot of heart but could have been better if it had been more focused. They introduced more plotlines than they could resolve, which is why they have the characters straight up describe the ending. In fact, the ending is a testament to how the film starts out *so* strong only to get weaker as it goes on. After being able to beautifully show without telling in the earlier part of the movie (like when Barbie sees the beauty of an elderly woman, or when Barbie starts picking up on an aggressive male gaze at the boardwalk), they resort to just describing feminism and patriarchy in the latter half of the movie. 

With that being said, the movie was so visually striking and fun that I adored it despite its flaws.",2023-08-03 14:58:07,41,movies,GH19971,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

276,"I'm not really understanding the high praise I'm seeing so far. 

This movie felt like it was all over the place in terms of the tone and the story it wanted to tell and many of the jokes were flat in delivery. It went on some weird existential romp that felt unearned and there weren't really any emotional payoffs. The subplots with Will Ferrell and America Ferrera felt very shoehorned in with no real point, the daughter was annoying the entire film, and honestly Gosling seemed to be the only consistent bright spot as Robbie put in a pretty bland performance overall. And that monologue? It felt like a bad SNL sketch that kept going on and on before commercial break. Super weird and didn't feel genuine or earned at all. 

This is nowhere near either Lady Bird or Little Women in terms of quality for me and I'm rather disappointed after looking forward to this for a while now. Terrible screenplay and a sloppy mess for most of its runtime, I can't really see myself ever recommending this to anyone.",2023-07-21 09:09:54,41,movies,Karametric,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

Didn‚Äôt feel like a women vs men or had any ‚Äúfuck white incels‚Äù moments, just a fun, good hearted movie that shows how the patriarchy fucks us all over.

278,"Just saw the movie last night. I enjoyed it, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were great - they did a good job. Really, all of the cast were great in their roles and with what they were given. The movie was more 'meta' than I was expecting it to be, and I thought it was well-executed more than it wasn't. However, overall I thought the movie was half-baked (two-thirds-baked? some fraction of not fully baked?! I don't know) - I get the intent behind it, I just thought it wasn't executed as tightly or cleverly as it could have been.

I think back to 'Enchanted"", which to me has a very similar premise and very similar messaging, but I thought was done much better with more fun and more heart than Barbie. Even the 'ridiculous' moments like the spontaneous musical numbers felt more 'natural' in Enchanted than the ridiculous moments in Barbie.

288,"I hate that I didn‚Äôt love this movie, I was so excited for it. I‚Äôm a woman that played with Barbies as a little girl & a feminist that loves nothing more than a rich story about female empowerment. I just did not enjoy this movie beyond the first 20-30 or so minutes. The messaging felt so heavy handed, like to me there was nothing subtle or nuanced about this movie. 

The way they approached certain topics fell so flat for me. Over & over they referenced ‚Äúthe patriarchy‚Äù but I‚Äôm not sure that young 13 year old girls & boys (using 13 since the movie is technically PG13) are going to walk away from this movie really understanding what that means & how living in a patriarchal society impacts their lives & their futures. They talked a lot about it without actually saying anything at all. 

I think Barbie experiencing the real world would have been a better focus for the movie. Having her experience the world as we know it & how it often feels to be a woman in our world (I thought they were going in that direction when she interacted with those construction workers but that didn‚Äôt really go anywhere). & show Ken also experiencing that same world as a contrast. 

Have her really bond with that mother & daughter & connect with them. & learn about their different experiences as a young girl & woman navigating the world. They were such a wasted plot point. When she chose to be human I was like why? She was in the real world for like an hour. What did she experience that made it so appealing? Maybe one thing she realized she‚Äôs missing is true connection with others, maybe she wants to help make the world a better place for that teenage girl she‚Äôd grown to love. That would have been a beautiful journey for her & a way to discuss feminism with some nuance. 

I‚Äôve seen a couple people comparing this movie to Legally Blonde & saying Legally Blonde did it better. I‚Äôd agree. Legally Blonde was colorful & sparkly & feminine but also empowering & it‚Äôs messaging was subtle but impactful. I was actually only 9 years old when Legally Blonde came out but I saw it in theaters & I still remember walking out of that theater thinking ‚ÄúWow‚Ä¶I could go to Harvard one day too. I could be a Lawyer. I could be anything.‚Äù

So yeah, I didn‚Äôt enjoy it. I laughed a few times, it was beautiful to look at, & I thought the acting was fine. But I was disappointed & thought there was a lot of wasted potential. I understand the gender-swapping, Barbie Land was a matriarchy & became a patriarchy. I get it. Just did not enjoy it. I did enjoy Alan, though. That gimmick was a trip. 

TLDR; It wasn‚Äôt for me. 6/10",2023-07-24 00:27:51,40,movies,mydogislife_,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
289,"Honestly surprised Mattel allowed a movie like this to be made, I would never have expected a Barbie movie like this to have been made. This went past my expectations in every way, I just loved it. It was much funnier than I expected, and also serious enough when it needed to be. The serious moments hit well, I kinda teared up at one point, and it didn't feel too cheesy or anything. I loved that they brought in the actual creator of Barbie as a character, I knew it was supposed to be her the first time they showed her, but I didn't expect them to acknowledge it and give her character a more extended role at the end, I figured it would just kinda be a cameo. 

Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were born to play Barbie and Ken I feel, both of them were perfect casting (despite that one fourth wall break about Margot Robbie being cast in her role). The entire cast was great, but those two were just phenomenal. America Ferrera also felt genuine enough in her delivery to make her monologue work.

My entire theatre was full and the vibe seemed like everyone was loving the movie too, hope this is finally the summer blockbuster this year's been missing. But also idk how word of mouth will be, I feel like this movie might be very different from what a general person might expect from a movie named *Barbie*.

291,"So I've read a lot of comments about how the Barbie's should have done better and given equal opportunity to the Kens. And you know what no.

When the dialogue happened where they weren't given a a seat on the supreme Court I felt a tinge of ""this isn't right, they should do better and do the right thing"". I even thought ""but the kens are so simple minded they couldn't possibly handle that"" and then I realized..... This is how men have viewed women forever. So yes the Ken's should get a seat just as women in the real world should get a full seat..... But. But we haven't. We've started to but we haven't. And the barbie world is a reflection of the real world in inverse so when the men in our world shape up the Barbies will. 

As for the people saying the Barbies should lead by example... There's a saying from the bible people like to quote ""do unto others"" that frankly I think gets hammered into women more than men. At least on gendered issues. Cause historically men haven't followed it where women are concerned. And why should the Barbies start change.... Their society is relatively new compared to the real world oppression of women. You're just expecting us to be polite and civil like you have basically enslaved us to be for thousands of years. It's on men to start change now. I don't think that's unfair.

As for the people not liking how the Barbie's manipulated the Ken's into fighting each other.... Tough fucking shit. They brainwashed, enslaved, and made the Barbie's homeless with no rights. All's fair in that scenario. Yes it's bad to manipulate a romantic partner that way but if that's the stakes.... Have at 'er.

308,"It started out really promising but then towards the end four separate plotlines got mushed together into a whole blurry mess (Barbie on what it means to be human, Ken's patriarchy saga, the whole mother-daughter story and whatever Will Ferrell was doing).  


*By far* the most interesting of these plotlines is Ken's story, and I feel like if the filmmakers had focused on this it could've been a great satirical comedy on how the ""oppressed"" Kens reclaim their self identity and gain mutual respect with the Barbies, turning the whole gender norm on its head. I get why they couldn't do that - the irony of having Barbie's movie be ultimately about Ken would fly over most people's heads  - but because of that they sacrificed coherence and ultimately made the film lose both its steam and focus. I was expecting to love this film based on both its visuals and the director's prior work but it ended up being one of my biggest disappointments of the year.",2023-08-16 04:24:58,37,movies,whattayawant,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

310,"As much as I hate to say this, I left the theater feeling a bit disappointed. Overall, I did like it, but there are some things I would have changed plot-wise that I feel would have greatly improved and cleared up the message of the movie (see below).

**PROS**   
\* The acting   
\* The amazing Barbieland sets  
\* Superb costuming   
\* The ‚Äúplot twist‚Äù that it was the mother‚Äôs memories, not the daughter‚Äôs  
\* Ken realizing he is Kenough without Barbie  
\* The inclusion of Weird Barbie (we all had her)  
\* Humor, and Mattel‚Äôs self-deprecating humor  


  
**CONS**   
\* No plot got to be explored or resolved the way it deserved because there were too many to tackle. (Matriarchy vs. Patriarchy, Mattel Executives, Barbie wanting to be human, Mom and daughter conflict)  
\* The ending (multiple aspects of it)  
\* Sasha‚Äôs (the tween girl) character was insufferable for me personally. Too intense and cold (bullying Barbie and calling her a fascist at age 12)

Things I would have changed about the plot:

1. Focus primarily on the **plot of Barbie wanting to be human**, and Matriarchy vs. Patriarchy as the secondary plot. The movie ends with Barbie wanting to be human, but we only got one scene at the beginning of the movie where she takes in Real World‚Äôs humanness. In fact, in the middle part of the movie, all she wants is things to go back to how they were before she visited Real World, because everything was perfect. Her humanness is never mentioned again until the last 5 minutes of the movie. In my opinion, this should have been the primary plot of the film and could have been explored SO deeply using the theme *‚ÄúBarbie (even though she is perfect) sees how imperfectly perfect humans are, and wants to feel what they feel despite it being messy sometimes.‚Äù* This also would have gone hand-in-hand with the Mom‚Äôs speech about the trials of being a woman, and her suggestion of an Ordinary Woman Barbie. Because women are not perfect despite the standards set, but there is beauty in the mess/realness - just like Barbie realizes (and decides she wants randomly in the last 5 minutes).
2. I wish they ended the movie with the Barbies and Kens realizing that **Matriarchy and Patriarchy are both not ideal**, because either Barbies or Kens will always feel less-than and under appreciated. In this day and age, *why are we not promoting more togetherness*? There was a great opportunity at the end for President Barbie to give Kens a valuable role in government, but it is quickly shot down. Then, there were comments from Barbies along the lines of ‚Äúthey have to start somewhere‚Äù and ‚Äúthey will have as much power as women do in the Real World.‚Äù I get the point they were trying to make, but still think it was a HUGE missed opportunity to promote men and women both seeing each other as valuable and having innate worth within society.
3. In the last scene of the movie, I was expecting Barbie to be interviewing for a job or something. Her being at a gynecologist was funny, but I would have also loved for us to see her **earning a high position on Mattel‚Äôs board** and introducing Ordinary Woman Barbie, or something along those lines - after all, she did say she doesn‚Äôt want to BE the idea, she wants to be the one creating the ideas! Also, the point of Barbie is that women can do anything and wear pink, heels, and be divinely feminine while doing it. At the end of the film in the Real World, she is wearing beige and Birkenstocks. What a statement it would have been to see her being a girlboss in the real world while still totally owning her love of pink, especially since at the beginning of the movie, she is against the Birkenstocks that Weird Barbie wants her to try.
4. Lastly, the whole movie is about how the patriarchal Real World is awful compared to Barbieland. Then, when Barbieland is turned into a patriarchal society by the Kens, the Barbies hate it and devise a plan to overthrow it, and they succeed. But at the end, **does Barbie just forget everything she fought for** in Barbieland when she turns into a human and essentially enters the man-run world she worked so hard to fix? At the end, it would have been great to have Barbie indicate that another reason she wants to turn human is to **help Real World women** gain more equality and respect, like she thought had already been accomplished at the beginning of the movie. (so that Real World is more like the Barbieland in my rewritten plot, since the Barbies and Kens respect and value each other as equals)
5. One more note... I would have given the **Kens a bit more substance** than BEACH. It was humorous, but almost saying that Barbies are in charge simply because the Kens have infant brains with no thoughts whatsoever. In reality though, we should be portraying the message that Barbies are in charge because of THEIR intelligence, leadership skills, etc. instead of Ken‚Äôs lack thereof.

Things I felt were unnecessary to the plot:

1. The **Mattel Executives** should have gotten less screen time, or should have helped move the plot forward in some way. There was really no purpose for them despite chasing Barbie around. And once they got to Barbieland, they were also pretty useless. Maybe they could have helped the Barbies and Kens work out their issues since they *literally created them.*
2. The **mother and daughter conflict** honestly didn‚Äôt add much to the story for me. There wasn't any development there. And, like I said before (and it could just be me) the daughter‚Äôs character was too much and so disrespectful. It would have been the same story if they didn‚Äôt have such a bad relationship, and the mom started playing with Barbie again just because she was *mourning the loss of her daughter‚Äôs childhood* as she transitions into a young woman. This ‚Äúmourning the loss of the childhood‚Äù could have also been the explanation of Barbie‚Äôs death thoughts.

Again, I did like the movie but think it could have been better and more meaningful. I love reading everyone else's thoughts on it too.",2023-07-24 17:23:27,37,movies,yyblocc,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

313,While I enjoyed the film I feel that overall the writing was a letdown for me. The third act was the weakest one and unfortunately it‚Äôs the one that‚Äôs most important to the message. It felt incredibly heavy handed at times especially with the Am√©rica Ferrera scene. With it being so heavy handed and on the nose about the patriarchy I can‚Äôt help but think about the actual reality they put a spotlight on but don‚Äôt seem to really have an answer for. At the end of the day the CEO of Mattel and WB are still men and they‚Äôre the ones profiting off this and will continue to sell their products and continue adding to the issue.,2023-07-21 04:11:33,36,movies,Only_live__,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
314,"Did nobody find Barbie‚Äôs plot very problematic?

Barbie was an excellent film. Very entertaining, great acting, great set pieces, everything. 

However, I actually found the plot very problematic and I am surprised no one else feels this way? 

No I don‚Äôt have an issue with the feminist themes. I think it is incredibly problematic however to make the goal of a film‚Äôs protagonist to reinstate a power asymmetry.

The Ken‚Äôs are happy at the start of the film, but they have no power. The land is ran by Barbie‚Äôs, all important jobs are held by Barbie‚Äôs, and Ken‚Äôs aren‚Äôt even allowed in the dream houses at night. 

When the Ken‚Äôs take over, it is Barbie‚Äôs goal to reinstate the Barbie regime. 

So to reiterate, a marginalized group‚Äôs rebellion against an oppressive regime is quashed and that is the happy ending? Even at the end of the movie when the Ken‚Äôs ask for a Supreme Court judge, they are told no. 

I fully expected the return of power to have some Ken inclusion, although I realize this may undermine the message of the movie.

This is not a male - female dynamic that is problematic, it is a group based power dynamic which is highly problematic when applied to other groups. 

I was personally a little shocked that the goal of the protagonist‚Äôs was to reinstate a hegemonic power. 

I know some people are calling this movie too ‚Äòwoke‚Äô but I think it is actually extremely unwoke in this way.",2023-07-29 16:34:23,36,movies,godhimself2,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
315,"I can't believe there are people zoning in on President Barbie denying Ken an immediate higher position and calling that hypocritical, all while ignoring Ken's actual, *real* empowerment. The entire point of the resolution here is supposed to be a flip on the way tokenism works. In the real world, it's common to make a woman CEO and call it a day and tell them to stop complaining (literally happens earlier when the exec brings up the two women CEOs), but there's rarely ever actual empowerment that's encouraged, which is about identity.

Compare that to the movie and it's the exact opposite because they're urging that Ken figure out his identity SEPERATE from Barbie, which is what actual empowerment is. But that's not how it works irl because a big part of patriarchy relies on defining what the idea and role of a woman should be according to men. Women are not encouraged (and in a lot of places not even allowed) to figure out their identity separate from men.

If you watch this movie and think the message is men = bad or that it's about ""female superiority"" then idk man. It just reinforces the entire point of the movie which is that patriarchal systems of thinking negatively affect both men and women and is a net negative to the world. It's also true that it affects women to a larger degree due to them not having as much power.",2023-07-22 14:45:09,36,movies,solarpowersme,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
316,"Wound up actually watching the movie yesterday after kinda getting sucked into the online culture war previously. Wish I had just watched it first. Yes, clearly it is a feminist movie. And there are random political rants sprinkled in the movie.

But it‚Äôs not an ‚Äúanti-men‚Äù film, it‚Äôs an anti Alpha-male/Tate film. I can definitely resonate much more with that message than what 4chan‚Äôs and the Shapiro‚Äôs of the world had led me to believe- that ‚Äúthis is a film about men being slaves and rising up, only to become slaves again at the end because all men are evil and stupid and weak compared to women‚Äù.

I enjoyed it. The visuals are marvelous, it‚Äôs modestly funny, and the acting from the lead characters was excellent. Might be my favorite performance from Ryan Gosling, and that‚Äôs saying a lot.",2023-08-10 11:46:01,36,movies,Money_Whisperer,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
317,"Let the downvotes rain, baby! I called it - Ken was the villain at the end, the whole movie was commentary on how women and men should go their separate ways, how men can only be incels or misogynists and that women are the future. Let's get this straight - Barbies have all of the power, Ken discovers what feels like to be in power and wants this for the people like him as well, switches how things are in Barbieland, Barbie turn Kens against each other and everything goes back to how it was with the Barbies in charge. What exactly this tells us? Did I miss the point? Also, Ken learns that he needs to be independent from Barbie while literally still being second to Barbie, who breaks free and becomes a ""human being"". Because women are the enlightened, the future, while men are these idiots who can not live without women and have to still learn to be independent. I have to call all of my single male friends, who have refused to be in a relationship, because women are high maintenance, and let them know that they are the peak of what men can be. ""But this is only about incels!"" Yeah, right, like the whole feminist movement lately have been anything but ""men bad, women best"". 

After this brief feat of rage - I support the message, though - my existence does not depend on a Barbie, I have to be my best self for me and my happiness should not be tied to another person. I am still not sure if feminists wants us to be equal in society, but at least Ken at the end had a redeeming and ""empowering"" moment and did not die as ignorant villain, for which I should be thankful, I guess.",2023-07-21 06:34:01,36,movies,slowlolo,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

The Ken songs at the end felt out of place.

No one laughed at the Mattel Executives. They were painfully unfunny.

The mopey little girl became happy without a real explanation.

The Nicky Minaj song, unsurprisingly, sucked.

I did enjoy the Space Odyssey tribute.  And the dance party where Barbie thinks about death was pristinely directed. And a great Dua Lipa song to boot.  But then it sort of fizzled.

324,"As a guy I thought it was a 'good movie', loved the visuals, really liked the overall world building, and humor.  I absolutely loved about  75% of it.  Only a few missteps keep it from being a great/perfect barbie movie:

1. The unbearable brooding fem-natzi teen archtype. Being that I was a nice teen growing up, it sucks seeing writers shoehorn the overly-smug negative-teen (who also hates thier extra sweet loving parent) archtype into movies where it serves no narritive purpose. The daughter was unnecessary, and really served no purpose plotwise.  Either cut her or at least make her a bearable side character.

2.They leaned into the feminst angle too hard. While I am not a proponent for modern feminism in general, I do think the male vs female, ""Partriarch"" vs Barbieland was funny and could have continued  to fine throughout the movie if they would have just kept it light hearted and tounge and cheek, as these are concepts that Barbie and Ken have to contend with during thier exposure to the real world, and later during thier existential crisis'.  But by the time the mom started monolouging super hard with a feminist twist at weird barbies house, it took a fun movie into cringey eyer rolling feminist propaganda territory... 

Up to the point in the movie,  I was thinking how it would be a fun movie to watch with my kids (boys and girls), but after the narritive went full on anti-male, and the Barbies started to seduce the Kens and cause infighting/war... I changed my mind.  Not a message for kids on how to treat the opposite sex. 

Also, its always been a part of Barbies narrative that Barbie and Ken were an item, and have broken up maybe once. They could have played on this but... hollywood. It didnt make sense that Barbie showed NO interet in Ken.  

TLDR:

- 99% of the cast did a great Job.

- Great Visuals and Humor

- Ryan Gosling absolutely killed it. And stole the show.

- Enjoyed Will Pharrell

- Overall a good movie that could have been GREAT, but was *slightly* maligned by hollywoods need to make everything a political statement.

327,"I went in expecting it to be a movie crapping on men based on a bunch of biased takes on the movie from many sources. Instead did quite the opposite, bringing forth both issues of genders, and I like how Ken and Barbie both flipped through the antagonist and protagonist of each other throughout the film. The irony of the song ""push"" being played was great that mightve gotten lost on some people unfamiliar with matchbox 20. Personally, I really liked the ending sequence with Ken breaking down and crying, saying it's okay to cry and be open with his emotions, and especially the whole ""I am enough"" scene, realizing he doesn't need barbie nor does she need him, partially playing on the fact that Ken always was a side character/ an afterthought of the whole barbie franchise for people years ago but also as a statement to many men and women who put all their self worth based on their partnership or lack thereof. Didn't think I'd actually tear up at a movie like barbie but that whole segment struck a chord with me. 

I also appreciate the fact that it called out how barbies in the past (along with media as a whole) has really affected how a lot of women felt growing up and how difficult it is to deal with body issues in a world where women ""have to be skinny BUT not TOO skinny, you have to be xyz"" as one of the barbies mentioned, and how self conscious women have become due to the unrealistic expectations of media and the ""stereotypical barbie"".
All in all it was a pretty good movie with positive messages for both genders to take away from. Was wholesome enough to keep me captivated at what will happen next. Definitely a lot of humorous moments that got me to chuckle along with my friends and the people in the theater. The ""You are enough"" theme was great and I don't care what other biased sources complain about how problematic this movie is, because it isn't and anyone who says that completely missed all the underlying themes of the movie.

The reference to *2001: A Space Odyssey* at the beginning sets the movie up in that way, and the rest of the movie keeps delivering on that. 

I was so happy to see Rhea Perlman. It didn't know she'd be in it. The scenes with her kind of blew my mind. I kept thinking about Carla from *Cheers*. 

I lost it when Ken says ""I won a Nobel Prize in horses."" I needed that laugh so bad.

339,"Overall, I liked it. It was very funny. You really ended up caring for and connecting with Barbie and Ken because of Margot and Ryan. They were hysterically funny at times. Rarely do I laugh out loud to movies but this one got me several times.


I felt like the movie was supposed to be 30 minutes longer, but was forced to be cut down. The pacing in most of the movie, and particularly the first half, was terrible. Everything went by too fast. The movie didn't have time to breathe, which hurt some of the potential comedy and made many of the ""emotional"" moments later feel unearned and forced.


When Barbie sat on the bench and told the old woman she was beautiful, it wasn't as sweet a moment as it could have been, because the pacing was terrible. Just before, the movie jumped ultra-fast between events, and suddenly it slowed to a halt out of nowhere. This makes the moment feel tacked on and unnatural. The pacing was a consistent problem in the movie.


The mother and daughter characters (I don't even remember their names) also didn't have enough time to breathe. Barbie and Ken, who were not even fully ""human"", felt WAY more ""human"" to me than the mother and daughter, because they had more time to 'breathe', so to speak.

When the mother had her monologue about patriarchy, it could have felt way more satisfying than it did. I wished I felt the way about the monologue as I did with Taraji P. Henson's in [Hidden Figures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j6p7ajuh-E), or Laura Dern's in [Marriage Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zpwbyrpzi4Y), or Frances McDormand's in [Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Erg09oOpmo). Monologues out of frustration and anger can be so damn satisfying. The message of the monologue was fantastic, but because the character was so underdeveloped, and everything so rushed, it was more eye-rolling than satisfying. It was cringe-inducing coming from that character.

All media should try to ""show"" and not ""tell"", and this movie failed here. The movie had already shown its message - the executives at Mattel are all male, and they have created a fake version of ""woman"", and imposed that ideal on real women and girls. They *literally* try to force Barbie into a box representing this ideal, and she refuses. It's way more satisfying, as an audience member, to figure out the message ourselves rather then being told it explicitly. She didn't need the patriarchy monologue to be that explicit and unnaturally forced. It could have been satisfying (like the monologues I posted earlier), but this one failed for me

The daughter was also extremely underdeveloped. It was like she was written by a 50 year old who tried to make a parody of ""annoyed gen z teenager"". No teenager actually acts like that. Why did she suddenly bring up the genocide of american indigenous people? No teenager actually says ""that's appropriating"" when their father speaks spanish. The ""annoyed teenager"" can be pulled off MUCH better, like in Bo Burnham's Eight Grade, which featured the ""annoyed teenager"" as a real human being with thoughts and emotions. This one felt like a megaphone, not a character.

The positives:

- Insanely funny, most of the time

- Margot Robbie was a developed, three-dimensional, hilarious main character who you felt tremendous empathy for

- Ryan Gosling has never been more funny and charismatic in a movie, ever. This was Oscar nomination worthy

- Overall fantastic message, and I'm overjoyed it didn't try to defend Barbies as being ""feminist, actually"". From the first few minutes, it mocked the idea that Barbies are ""empowering"" for women and girls. Barbies are top-down manufactured ideals of ""femininity"", and ""femininity"" is NOT what being a woman/girl is. It's a masquerade imposed on them top-down. The movie understood this.

- Opening scene was incredible, closing scene was hilarious, leaving you with an overall good impression


The negatives:


- Felt way too rushed and cut down

- The mom and daughter characters were awfully underdeveloped, making them more cringe-worthy than relatable

- Some of the humor with the Mattel executives fell completely flat as they, too, were underdeveloped. Some of the jokes felt like they would be funny if you knew the characters, but we never got time to know them.


Most of the problems may be fixed if the movie was 30 minutes longer, and all the side characters got time to breathe.

340,"I respectfully did not enjoy all of the Barbie movie. 

The characters were generally annoying and I found most of the plot points to be offensive to both genders. Though, It kind of resolves this by the end. It had some funny moments. Demonizing both men and women as a bunch of unempathetic stupid assholes as a core theme, implying that woman has to apologize for a man‚Äôs bad behavior, or implying that women in the real world are not doing enough (but have to overcome their faults? It‚Äôs Opposite Day,you wrote the script into a corner.) No. I don‚Äôt agree that men are responsible for all of a woman‚Äôs problems. That‚Äôs ridiculous. No, I don‚Äôt agree that women are stupid subservient assholes either. Who was this movie meant for?

The final joke in the movie after the cheesy as fuck finale leads to Barbie being empowered to visit a gynecologist (and then everyone faked laughed together. fun.)

It‚Äôs fine. 5/10.

The movie ends with the Barbies perpetuating the exact treatment that women of the real world face except against the Kens. Is that really the takeaway message here? That it‚Äôs okay to treat the Kens as less than in Barbieland since women are treated as less than in the real world? Seems like a huge missed opportunity to relay an inspiring message of true equality.

On a more positive note Margot Robbie absolutely knocked it out of the park. She was amazing here. 

Edit- You guys can downvote me all you want but it doesn‚Äôt change that the fact that this is *literally* exactly what happens in the movie. I hope with some time and distance you can see that.",2023-07-30 04:17:34,34,movies,National_Duck8634,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

352,"

I think what personally got to me was that I was *excited* about the feminism aspect but it fell short. The speeches were just. Awfully scripted. The message was cloudy, too. It felt jarringly like a 2013 tumblr post, almost like a parody of itself. Like, the speech would have been groundbreaking two decades ago but today it felt weirdly commercial. 

Very much tell, not show. With all the speeches they couldn't devote time to representing what she was saying in the movie!! No time given to developing the deteriorating mother-daughter relationship that was shown to BE THE CAUSE of the entire plot. No time to show her struggling with her job and being a mother. Or the restricive body standards. Finacial inequality. Balancing being emotional and direct. ALL of these were stated in the speech and ignored the rest of the movie. But they had time for a whole unnecessary plotline with goofy mattel men and a 10 minute ken musical number. 

Instead misogyny was shown as ""girls should wear booby clothes and serve men beer"" as if thats even SLIGHTLY the what the patriarchy is. They could've had the women be encouraged to wear that but then be slutshamed for giving in. They could've had women WANT to be a server and be ashamed of it. 

The solution was presented as ""women just need to realize whats wrong and believe in themselves and everything's solved, misogyny eradicated, yippee!!"" it all felt so hollow - it feels like they solved their cheap version of inequality and we should be grateful for it because at least the ""real world"" isn't as bad - BUT IT'S WORSE!! WAY MORE PERVASIVE AND SUBTLE AND SOUL CRUSHING. 

I feel so sad that i feel this way because i am so easy to please when it comes to movies especially cinema blockbusters. I just wanted to like it!!",2023-07-26 16:56:40,34,movies,raynbooze,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

354,"It felt like there were two parts of this movie, and the division happens at some point during the Ken takeover. I won't rehash them in much depth, but I agree with all the comments about heavy-handedness and aimlessness, the second half is mostly air. Also, aside from Kate McKinnon and Michael Cera, the supporting cast was pretty useless, could have been played by anyone, the characters were empty and pointless (wow, I just called Will Ferrell useless).

\*However\*... the first half was freaking hilarious and very creative. I love how the movie embraced Barbie surrealism. I enjoyed Barbie drinking fake liquid and Ken smashing into the plastic ocean waves. I laughed a ton - some of my favorite moments included Gen Z'ers calling Barbie a fascist (I totally know Gen Z'ers who would do this), Ken talking to the mom and her daughter at the school about Barbie being kidnapped, Ken and Barbie in cowboy costumes (the fringe!!!). All the weird discontinued Barbies had me howling, especially pregnant Barbie. Michael Cera's character felt like it sprang from a joke in the writer's room about how funny it would be to awkwardly insert Michael Cera into this movie, and it worked.

I think this is a movie I'll go back to a lot when I'm high, and never finish it, but I'm glad I saw it through the once.

356,"I've been thinking more and idk I just don't love how they portrayed gender relations as some zero sum game, even if it was done tongue and cheek it was just kind of off to me.



Like I feel like they dove head first into the kind of stereotypes that feminists have had to work hard to shake off. Saying that ""gender relations have been solved"" when the only thing that has been ""solved"" is that now men are the ones oppressed just seems weird. Most real feminists would say that men are oppressed by patriarchy as well and that the goal of equality is a society where it's not ""Barbies House"" or ""Ken's House"".... But one where everyone has a house. Yet the movie ends where it began, with Ken back to just being homeless I guess and with the Barbies just not caring. As if the only state the movie can imagine is one where one gender has to have dominance over the other.



Also this is only kind of related but for some reason the jokes with that Dad character just seemed so mean spirited to me. Like, ""Hey look at this stupid asshole trying hard to learn a second language so he can communicate with his wife and daughter in their native language, what a dumbass let's laugh at him."" Just seemed like a weird thing to make fun of a character over.",2023-07-31 04:16:41,33,movies,jamiebond,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
357,"Watched it today, and I enjoyed it. The message about women empowerment and just pretty much how us men are was accurate. A scene i that got me thinking was when Gloria was talking about the role women play in life, especially in men‚Äôs life. How they pretty much have to be perfect, they have to be mothers but not show off their kids too much, being leaders but not being too hard/bossy. Yeah this applies to men too, but the expectation on guys isn‚Äôt that high. Men and women both experience different struggles, this movie covered a majority of women‚Äôs struggles, men are expected to shoulder all burdens and not complain or talk about our feelings. I‚Äôm not political whatsoever, but this movie reminded me of how much I appreciate women, and what they go through and what us men put them through.",2023-07-23 06:32:18,33,movies,Careless_Stable6468,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
358,"Am I being sexist, or does the matriarchy of barbieland treat the kens as bad if not worse than the real world treats women? I am genuinely asking.

I will make this clear: I am a male. I do not want to start something awful, and I do not want to be perceived as some hateful bigot. I like the movie, it was fun and had a lot of great points about the unfair double standards women have to weave through in the patriarchal society we live in. But there's a line in the movie that just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

When Barbie returns to barbieland with the mom and her daughter, she shows her around the dreamhouses and says that every Barbie lives in one of the dreamhouses. But when the mom asks where the kens stay, Barbie has no idea. That got me thinking; what do the kens even do?

No seriously, what are they allowed to do? What are they allowed to own? They don't have houses, they don't have cars, they don't even have real jobs, the only exception being lifeguard Ken to my memory. They just do things that most people would only have as either a hobby or athletic career. The only thing that they do to contribute to the Barbies is just stand aside and look nice.

I know how all this sounds, and I know that as a man I have no ground to stand on for a film about feminism. But they play up Barbie land as being something better than reality when all honesty, it just looks like the gender-band version of what we have today. Or more accurately, what we had 50 years ago. A world where one sex controls the world, and the other is just seen as an accessory.

359,"Unironically, this film totally got what it means to be a woman in a world where every imperfection is used against you. 

Barbie is about discovering your place, your identity in a world that wants to put you in a box. It‚Äôs about the conundrums and contradictions of femininity and the aching feeling of being judged to impossible standards. 

Its about the complexity of consciousness and the relationships we build with simple thoughts and actions that can last a wonderful lifetime. And that is what it means to be human in a world that‚Äôs always changing.

And a line that really stood out to me was, ‚Äúmothers stand still, so daughters can look back and see how far they‚Äôve comel‚Äù. Like god what a line. 

It was genuinely so amazing to see everyone all dressed up in pink and being excited for the movie. I saw my classmates all show in Barbie hats, pink shorts, and pink shirts.

- the acknowledgment that stereotypical barbie is not an achievable appearance and is incredibly unrealistic
- the fact that a group of men were behind the doll meant to ""empower women""
- barbie feeling violated and threatened in the real world while ken felt powerful and strong
- THE MOVIE DIDNT END WITH BARBIE DATING KEN! I LOVED THAT!
- i also loved how barbie said NO to ken and stood by it
- i also love that the movie ended with telling men to also find their own sense of identity in the patriarchy, and that they're more than what sexism tells them to be

There were funny scenes and the set was wonderful but some things went on too long like when they got too talkative and serious. They need scenes like that, I get it....but they did not need to be so long. I love sending a message but the America Ferrera speech could have been cut a bit, it went on too long to where the fun-ness of the movie kinda stalled. And she had one weird speech, I forget what it was about but it was after they found out the Kens were taking over Barbieland and the Barbies were brainwashed. She said something weird and out of place and too serious but I forget what it was. Her daughter was a little too much. A brat and then in typical cheesy fashion all of a sudden she falls hardcore into it ""lets save barbie, mom lets do this for you, I love you mom type behavior after being so angsty. It seemed not genuine. She could have played that down a bit. And the daughters speech to Barbie while she was with her friends was pretty cheesy too. And the speech with Ruth and Barbie at the end. I get they had to include an emotional punch but that just took the sails right out of the hype of how the movie had been going. There was dancing and chaos going then that quiet one on one speech slowed everything down and they still had another scene to go! The speech / talk between Ruth and Barbie went on entirely too long to where I was like wow what a buzzkill. They could have made that more simple and shorter.

It‚Äôs just saying this is how it‚Äôs been and firmly places this shitty experience into the shoes of the men watching who may understand, but never really placed themselves in that position before(okay I mean there is a whole conversation of marginalized groups like LGBTQ and racial groups who DO understand and experience this, so it isn‚Äôt a 1 to 1, but this is talking on the strict gender binary that Barbie is presenting)",2023-07-24 06:18:29,31,movies,nimal-crossing,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
385,"I loved a lot of elements in it. The humor is great, the tone is perfect, and Ryan Gosling is a gift to mankind. But I‚Äôm kinda let down by the absolute lack of a plot. The Mattel execs, the mother daughter dynamic, Barbie having to go find her real world user felt like ideas that needed a lot more rewrites before making their way into a Greta Gerwig film!!! I think the ending is great and really sticks the landing. But the middle was really disappointing to me. I get that the film was made to be a blockbuster and appeal to the ‚Äúgeneral audience‚Äù, but I felt a certain repetitiveness to the point the movie was trying to make.",2023-07-21 11:11:27,31,movies,,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
386,"I'm confused.
I went in expecting something amazing and it was really just meh.

I did enjoy the attention to detail, the performances (especially Ryan Gosling's) were very well done. But the script was just so... meh.
 
I'm trying to understand if there was something more to it that I didn't understand? Like I got the commentary and Kens' issues and the parallel of real world and Barbieland. But like... Was that it?

There were quite a few moments that felt so random, I felt like the script was a mess. The dialogues either didn't make any sense or they were so in-your-face and basic, there were no layers, if that makes any sense. It felt like they were just shouting random things they had heard from feminists hoping it sounds progressive and smart. (I am a feminist, I'm not saying it's bad that they did that. Just that there was absolutely no nuance to the dialogue.)

I did tear up 2-3 times but they also felt random. I just walked out of the movie right now and I can't even remember why I teared up!

Btw, what was the scene where the corporate guys were running after Barbie? I get that it was a commentary on how men are not necessarily the most competent just because they are men, but it fell so flat.

I don't know. Maybe I just don't get this kind of humour.

Edit: I forgot to say, it reminded me of that movie ""Downsizing"" where they just touched on every single issue and the genre changed a hundred times and it was just so messy. That.",2023-07-28 07:34:54,31,movies,Alternative-Row-309,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
387,"I felt like the movie was such a missed opportunity to deliver a great message because it failed in its execution.  


Ryan Gosling absolutely stole the show as Ken, and I found his arc and character much more interesting compared to Barbie and wish we had gotten a longer and deeper look into Ken's psyche and the relationship between Barbies and Kens. Also felt the film's resolution went by too quickly and could've been improved with more nuance into the more sinister aspects of patriarchy.  


Instead the movie got too heavy-handed with the messaging and missed the boat on 'showing' instead of 'telling'. That entire speech on patriarchy, while absolutely correct will still not land as well as Great Grewig might've hoped, which ultimately is a problem.  


A little more subtlety and nuance would've gone a long way into making this a much better film and landing its core message better.",2023-07-23 16:00:40,31,movies,DecimaThor,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

400,"Ok so I saw it and loved it but some parts did fall flat for me. 
1) The moms speech about the duality of womanhood. It felt like it was far too general to be relatable. As a woman myself I could relate to a few things but not the entire thing. I am sure lots of men could relate to it as well. It was so general I don‚Äôt think it was uniquely feminine. Also I don‚Äôt know why she was telling the Barbies all of this. Why would these non-human Barbie‚Äôs who have never experienced real Patriarchy understand this speech? I would‚Äôve liked it more if it had been a bit more personal to her own experience. Instead it felt like a buzz feed list she was rattling off. 
2) I think it‚Äôs pretty clear Ken didn‚Äôt bring the patriarchy to Barbieland. He brought what he THOUGHT was patriarchy but it was actually a sort of innocent misunderstood idea of masculinity. He basically brought with him the idea that horses and beer are awesome. And he even has that line where he says ‚Äúonce I realized the patriarchy didn‚Äôt have anything to do with horses I lost interest.‚Äù So I don‚Äôt understand why the Barbie‚Äôs are brainwashed as if the Kens brought a diabolical plague. It also lends to my first comment. I don‚Äôt see how the mom‚Äôs speech would be helpful to them when the Barbies haven‚Äôt actually experienced any of the paradoxes she‚Äôs talking about. 
3) I disagree with the people who think it‚Äôs anti man. I actually thought the scene where Ken has that montage moment and sees all these great moments in history that had to with men is a positive-masculinity moment. Nothing he saw was bad. It was all wholesome guy stuff. And I think it was clear from the movie that the way Ken is treated in Barbieland is sad and not the ideal.
4) one of the most touching moments to me was when Barbie talks with Ruth at the table. In my mind, Ruth is basically Barbie‚Äôs mom. In that scene we saw how amidst all the chaos and confusion Barbie has, she finds comfort and peace in having tea with her mom. And when Ruth says ‚Äúyou look different‚Äù and Barbie says ‚ÄúUsually I look perfect‚Äù and Ruth says ‚ÄúI think you look just right.‚Äù I thought that was so beautiful and I totally cried. 
5) I wish they would‚Äôve delved into the mom‚Äôs depression a bit more. The mom playing with Barbie to deal with depression and anxiety amidst her ever-changing life and distance from her daughter is a really interesting plot point but they didn‚Äôt flesh it out a whole lot. It gets brushed aside and I guess resolved without any real work being done? 

I have lots of thoughts floating around but these are the ones that are at the top of my brain. So overall, I really enjoyed the movie. I think in some ways it was trying to do too much and that‚Äôs where my criticism comes from.",2023-07-31 23:04:32,30,movies,,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
401,"I'm a 31 year old man. I absolutely loved this movie. I really enjoyed that it wasn't JUST about women empowerment because it's more than that. Even just a little bit about Ken learning to be enough for himself is a great message because a lot of people in general feel that they're not fulfilled if they're not in a relationship. As someone that is currently separated with their spouse, this really spoke to me.

Edited to add as it might seem like I don't like the women empowerment. I think it's a fantastic movie for women of all ages to watch and realize they can be what they want to be. I'm just glad it also added a sprinkle of something for Ken because I think that it's a real problem that people every day face in thinking they have to be in a relationship or have the perfect job.

402,"This probably is not a popular opinion I guess but I was somewhat disappointed with the movie. I went in knowing it would be a fun and feminist movie but I couldn't connect with the movie. It felt messy? The mother- daughter duo were just introduced, there was no time spent on developing their characters or making them familiar to the audience. I honestly don't know what their purpose was. When the mom gave that speech, it felt very generic and not very genuine idk. I had so many questions. Why was the mother depressed ? Did the kens put a spell on the Barbies? How did the speech break the spell ? Because for barbies all these real world women trouble would be completely foreign. I get what they were trying to show I guess but felt it was all over the place. Ryan gosling stole the show! Margot was amazing as well but I feel like she should've delivered the main dialogue because the Americas delivery wasn't very impactful I guess. Margot could've delivered the hard hitting emotional dialogues better imo. Please tell me I'm not the only one üò≠ Barbie being Greta's movie I was looking forward to it because I really liked her previous 2 movies that I watched which portrayed feminism in a subtle but very powerful way.

403,"I enjoyed the movie but do think it was way too heavy-handed/preachy. (Though I did like the monologue from Americas character and it stated the contradictions of expectations for women so well)

I think personally the better story here would‚Äôve been to focus more on the ‚Äúperfection‚Äù angle of Barbie and the standards women strive to fit. Covering the patriarchy as a whole was too big for this type of film imo and if it would‚Äôve just been about Barbie not being ‚Äúperfect‚Äù - and her learning to not just accept that, but appreciate it - then I think it would‚Äôve made her choosing to become human more impactful/logical. My favorite scene was her telling the old woman on the bench that she was beautiful. There are no old women in Barbie land, no wrinkles, etc. yet Barbie thought she was beautiful. To me it‚Äôs the first hint that she is different and when she admires everyone in the park, you get why maybe she‚Äôd want to be ‚Äúreal‚Äù too. Even though everything isn‚Äôt ‚Äúpretty‚Äù 100% of the time. The ken patriarchy plot was not really worth it to me but that‚Äôs just my opinion.

For Mattel to acknowledge that even while being ‚Äúempowering‚Äù Barbie still has to be ‚Äúpicture-perfect‚Äù and the way real women try to be that in every facet of our lives, would‚Äôve been really cool and the better message here to me.",2023-07-25 03:18:36,30,movies,Ittybittyvickyone,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

I feel like it HAD to say it so bluntly because people who ignore this stuff just would gloss over and say ""you're just seeing things"" like a lot of them constantly do. I also enjoy the fact that it was a movie geared toward women and poked fun at men in the same way their movies make fun of us (Synder cut joke, Godfather joke, etc.). I also loved that Barbie didn't get together with Ken and all Kens finally accepted they just wanted to be friends with Barbies!

The last scene with Ruth was brutal. ""Mother's stand so they can see how far their daughters go"" almost made me cry because it made me think of my mom.",2023-07-21 16:06:06,30,movies,jfsindel,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

412,"Overall pretty good, but way too preachy. 

The constant pointing things out was unnecessary and implies they think the audience is too stupid to figure out (very common in Hollywood nowadays). Kids even pick up on subtlety so it really just pulls you out of the movie, killing the suspension of disbelief.

So a few scenes talking about the patriarchy + Barbie not-so-subtly talking about being an object + Ken‚Äôs arc + Gloria‚Äôs speech= way too much 

But with the plot it just amplified things. Then with things like saying nonchalantly that the husband will be fine (with no concern for him) as Gloria & her daughter go to a different world , it just gave off this vibe‚Ä¶

It was good for Ken‚Äôs plot because they addressed it, but with Gloria‚Äôs speech about how she has to do all this and that and worrying constantly, yet we see her unconcerned about her husband when they go into a strange place with no idea when they‚Äôll return‚Ä¶it just felt a little‚Ä¶hypocritical?

I feel like a little editing could‚Äôve fixed that.

I wish they put more focus on the script, mainly with making a couple scenes more subtle, and especially with the Mattel board. 

With that said, the acting was really good from everyone, set design was fantastic. The intro was really funny & fun.

Ryan was hilarious. 
IMO his parts were the best parts of the movie. Several scenes I noticed he did little details like shake his fists for a few seconds when he was struggling with what he felt or he did this little tilt of his head which made him seem more doll like. Just amazing.
 
Great choreography of the dance & musical numbers‚Ä¶and of course the fight scene was great. There were a ton of things going on at once. My friend noticed things I didn‚Äôt & vice versa (like a Ken giving CPR to a stick-horse lol)

So really good movie but I think people forget that if you go too hard with inserting life lessons & preaching, it kills the fun. 

(Not to mention turns people who are sick of being talked down to, off from watching the movie). 

And here, it probably would‚Äôve taken a few minor changes to take a pretty good movie to make a flawless one.",2023-09-25 02:27:38,30,movies,SummSpn,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

414,"The movie was weird to me. I liked it, but still weird.

The movie was SUPPOSED to set forth an aspiration of gender equality in both Barbieland and the real world. But all that sentiment came secondary in focus to the fact, pushed incessantly that a men-run world (whether the real life ‚Äúpatriarchy‚Äù or The Kendom) is the embodiment of evil and instead of pushing for equality, the Barbies insisted on re-subjugating the Kens. They also remove the concept of Kens and Barbies pairing up, seemingly leaving all but Margot Robbie‚Äôs character without any sort of meaning or meaningful relationship in life.

Overall, I felt like you could take a couple of different, competing takeaways from the movie. In the real world, there is a fight going on against a male-dominated ‚Äúpatriarchy,‚Äù from which women must be liberated and take power. Yet when the Kens do the same thing when they are even more repressed in Barbieland, they are vilified and their work must be undone to restore Barbieland. That premise is never seriously questioned. Therefore, it follows logically that‚Ä¶ men in the real world should stop women‚Äôs efforts to gain their own rights and power? Or, should men just be subjected in both worlds? Obviously that‚Äôs not the intent of the movie, but the morality that it insisted on prescribing leads to implications that its creators otherwise wouldn‚Äôt support.

I didn‚Äôt feel like the movie needed to make any broad statements other than that women can do anything, can look different from one another, etc and that there‚Äôs no one blueprint for a woman (or anyone). I thought that was nice enough. Everything else felt forced and, as others have said, like a freshman‚Äôs gender studies paper. Not to mention all the out-of-place anti-capitalist rhetoric and weirdly calling Barbie a ‚Äúfascist.‚Äù",2023-07-22 06:12:32,29,movies,eatinsomepoundcake,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
415,"Holy shit that was great.

Every joke landed.   It was absolutely wonderful writing and acting.   The meta of it all wasn't overdone and had easily a top 3 joke in a film littered with great humor.

Rhea Pearlman was a fucking delight and every moment she was in, she and Margot had remarkable chemistry.  Genuinely felt like a mother daughter connection (from Greta Gerwig?  Who could have possibly seen that coming? /s).

Every Ken was fantastic but I kept laughing to myself over the Sex Education Barbie/Ken pairing.  

Though of course Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu were phenomenally well done rivals and Gosling absolutely slayed with his comedic timing, singing, and just overall wonderment....and God the horses.

Margot Robbie was ABSOLUTELY the right choice for this and not to shit on Amy Schumer but there's no way that version of the movie would have been as good as this.  Margot hit it out of the park with the full range of emotions and 3...even 4 dimensional aspects.  Got the mannerisms of a Barbie doll down during the running scenes especially...it's the little things like that that really elevated this movie. Plus as I said earlier her chemistry was great...with EVERYONE.  From the random Midge to Ferrell to Aaron.  A beaming light of energy.   But her best moments were with America Ferrera who had maybe her best film role since Real Women Have Curves.  Those two were electric and again Gerwig captured the essence of a girl and her doll and the love between them.

I'm sorry to gush but I fucking adored every second of this movie.

Also...I've only had Allan and the Zak Snyder's Justice League joke for only 2 hours but I'd die for both of them.

Oh...poor Matchbox 20 catching massive strays in this movie.

416,"I think this movie is kind of suffering with how overhyped it is because I was expecting a masterpiece like Everything, Everywhere, All At Once, but this movie is just okay. I think the jokes were pretty funny, but the pacing just seemed fast at times. 

I feel like my biggest gripe with the film is that Barbie and Ken spent so little time in the real world. Ken discovers patriarchy, and Barbie discovers how hard being a woman is so quickly, and it just feels rushed. I think the movie would've benefitted greatly, having fewer Barbie world scenes and more real world scenes. 

My other problem is the lack of focus on Gloria and Sasha's relationship. Sure, we saw them sort of grow in having a relationship, but it wasn't enough, and I think the movie missed out on showing how Barbie has really impacted generations of women who grew up playing the dolls and how Gloria and Sasha played with the dolls as kids.

As for the ""controversial"" feminism aspect of the film, I think I will be even more controversial in saying that I don't think the feminist discourse in the film went far enough. Barbie has been created in pretty much every race and ethnicity, so I felt it was kind of a loss to not discuss much of intersectionality in feminism and recognize that the discrimination women face is often compounded by their race, ethnicity, cultural background, etc. But I suppose this wouldn't have been included in the film because the girl boss feminism featured was already getting enough sensitive people's feelings hurt. 

Also, the Mattel squad of bumbling idiots was really unnecessary. Pretty much every scene featuring them could've been cut from the film, in my opinion. 

In conclusion, I wish I hadn't heard about all the hype surrounding the Barbie movie because it set my expectations to really lofty ideals that the movie didn't meet. I would watch again for the jokes and the acting, but the plot leaves so much to be desired.",2023-08-15 15:09:53,29,movies,eleventyseventynine,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

418,"So I just got back from Barbie 2023 my most anticipated movie of the year. And i didn't just like it...I loved it. I love this movie. I don't even know how to describe it in words without spoiling it, it's one of those movies tou just have to see for yourself to believe. Not only because it's extremely funny and also the flawless set design of Barbieland. But also the film goes surprisingly heavy and existential in its themes, and I think men need to see this movies as well, because I see people online claim this movie is ""Anti-Men"" that is dishonest and a lie in every sense of the word. 

If anything, the film is Pro-Gender Equality, as the film basically deals with womanhood and how truly hard it is to be a woman in this world, and why they should be treated as equals, and the film hits the point hard, allowing the dramatic moments to hit even harder. It's also anti-Toxic Masculinity and shows that men shouldn't be acting like sexist jerks, as that doesn't make look ""strong"" or ""cool"" at all. So yeah, anyone who says the film is ""Anti-Men"" is wrong, and like I said, the film handles its actual themes of Pro-Gender Equality and Anti-Toxic Masculinity brilliantly, and I love how this film gets heavy even when it didn't need too. 

But make no mistake, the film is still a comedy. And man oh man, does comedy land extremely well. I am into very weird humor, and this film is exactly that and I love it. It had made laughing quite a few times, one sequence in particular involving Will Ferrells character was probably the funniest in the whole movie, however I will not spoil it. Also the performance were great as well.

419,"Went in expecting a lighthearted comedy. 

It's definitely not lighthearted and while there are plenty of attempts to be comedic, it just didn't work (Ryan Gosling aside).

The bigger issue though is the never-ending spiel of how-hard-it-is-to-be-a-woman, which frankly doesn't resonate at all in 2023. I could literally feel the theater cringe any time the movie delved into that (which is often). The western world has bent over backwards over the last 50-odd years to ingratiate women into all aspects of society. Yet with the amount of whinging this movie does about supposed inequality, you'd think it was the 1950's.

422,"I went to see Barbie in the theaters. Everything was absolutely perfect except the plot. I adored the characters, the costumes were excellent, the music was amazing, and the set was phenomenal!

But, although I loved these aspects of the movie, I didn't like the movie. 

I felt like the movie didn't focus on the right theme. When Stereotypical Barbie first met the Sasha, Sasha made a statement about how Barbie was an unrealistic expectation of what girls should be (aka Blonde, skinny, perfect complexion). Stereotypical Barbie then tells her that Barbie wasn't supposed to be an unrealistic expectation but an inspiration that girls could be anything. I absolutely loved the idea of changing the stigmatism around Barbie by reinforcing that she is an inspiration of what a girl could be (hence all the different Barbie skin colors/ hair colors/ professions/ etc) and not a perfect idea of what a girl should be.

But then the movie's message started to change with focus being on Ken and his misunderstanding of what a man should be and what a woman should be, making the movie about Patriarchy v. Matriarchy. The focus slipped away from Barbie and idea that Barbie is a doll that instills inspiration into young girls and simply became a men vs. women movie.

I also felt there were many cheap references about the objetification of women in the real world. Although I understood the writers used these allusions to estabish the idea that Stereotypical Barbie was now in the imperfect, harsh real world, I felt like the writers should have focused more on showing all the imperfections of the real world (including that women are objectified in the real world but also including a homeless person here or a stray dog there...maybe even a couple yelling at each other). This way, instead of simply showing that the real world was harder for women, it would reinforce the idea that Stereotypical Barbie had left her utopia for the harsh reality of the real world. 


To make a long story short, I felt that Barbie should have focused more on the purpose and symbol of the Barbie doll with a subplot that dealt with Barbie v. Ken (and Ken's purpose) instead of focusing the movie on a Men vs. Women plot. I would have enjoyed it a lot more.

All the good vibes died about 20ish minutes into the movie. It really just seemed like this was the directors hatred of men being brought to bear, as the Barbies seem vindictive and malicious, the Kens are moronic manchildren, and the end of the movie basically makes it out to be that the Kens and Barbies need to separate, which would imply that they think men and women should seperate.

441,"This movie hit a sweet spot for me in terms of blending goofy, campy, ""dumb"" humor with more clever, snappier jokes. Not every specific bit landed with me, but overall I like its full commitment to the absurdity of the world. *This is silly and kinda ridiculous, so let's just freakin'* go *for it and embrace that inherent goofiness.* I find that type of unapologetic boldness pretty endearing.

I haven't really waded into all the discourse about the politics of this movie -- is it feminist? is it feminist in the proper way? is it woke? is it not woke enough? is it sufficiently subversive? is it secretly capitalist propaganda? Not that those questions are irrelevant, to be clear. The social commentary in this movie is, of course, upfront and unsubtle. But I didn't go in expecting, like, an Andrea Dworkin Barbie or a Barbie recitation of the SCUM Manifesto or anything similarly outright confrontational, nor was I expecting to have my worldview forever altered by the searingly insightful social critique of a PG-13 summer blockbuster. I wanted some good laughs and some pleasantly basic pro-women messaging, and that's what I got, so I'm satisfied there.

As many others have highlighted, Gosling is superb. I knew he had good comedic chops from The Nice Guys, but I think there's a difference between being willing to ""look silly"" doing Shane Black faux-lowbrow-but-actually-highbrow dialogue and willing to ""look silly"" in something as outlandish and garish and campy as Barbie. It really feels like he's having an absolute *blast* playing Ken. He and Robbie both feel so committed to their characters, and even though there are times when the movie winks at the audience a bit (I'm thinking of a specific 4th-wall breaking bit of meta narration that I don't want to spoil), it doesn't feel like either of the two leads are winking in their performances -- *haha, isn't it just so silly that I'm in a movie like this?* Their commitment really sells the movie's heart.

And speaking of heart: America Ferrera, take a bow. She always oozes this sort of relatable sincerity, and her role really adds to the emotional depth of the film overall. I do wish the movie had spent a bit more time setting up the dynamic between her and her daughter; their arc felt cute and heart-warming but didn't really *move* me because I didn't ever really truly sense the tension between them. It was there in the dialogue, but I didn't *feel* it. But that shortcoming falls more on Gerwig than Ferrera, I feel, so that's not really a knock on the latter's performance.

Overall this was a really fun theater experience, and I'm glad Barbie is having the success it's having (even though Hollywood will undoubtedly learn all the wrong lessons from it). It's not a genius masterpiece and it's not a world-upending feminist treatise and it's far, far from perfect...and that's okay, I think. It's big and bold and just *tries* shit -- some of it works, some if it definitely doesn't, but the energy and momentum is palpable. Obviously this movie's style won't be for everyone, but I do feel its appeal is pretty broad. My second favorite movie of the year after Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves.",2023-08-17 03:15:36,28,movies,aprilnxghts,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
442,"Just saw it today and it was... okay. Honestly more of a wasted opportunity than anything else. I just felt like the movie, like Stereotypical Barbie herself, didn't really know what it wanted to say. The feminist message wasn't anything new, though I did enjoy America Ferriera's monologue. I liked Ryan Gosling as Ken so much more than I thought I was going to. Simu Liu was also pretty delightful. At the same time, I felt like the movie was missing a very big chunk surrounding what exactly happened when Ken came back to Barbieland and the Ken narrative in general. Honestly, we've all seen feminist critiques or reclamations of Barbie, the doll and the concept. It was revolutionary to me when I was a teen girl in the 00's. Not so much anymore in the age of 4th-Wave feminism.

What the movie had a great chance to do, and didn't, is to show that the core of feminism is about equality and equity for both men and women and that trying to have a society where any one group of people hold all the power is morally wrong no matter who is in that group. The movie made the mistake that most people that try to portray a matriarchy did, in that it just swapped the labels, but kept the contents the same and, in doing so, tip-toed right over the point. Ryan Gosling's Ken was compelling to me because he was such a good opportunity to show how men can become alienated and isolated from a society that assigns them to gender roles that are just as restrictive as those for women. Will Ferrel's character would have been such a perfect way to showcase how powerful men enforce negative patriarchal ideals on other men around them while paying lip service to feminism, and how easily a disillusioned and isolated man can miss the nuance and just blame women for his feelings of inadequacy. It would also have been nice to see how Ken was able to influence the other men and how some of the Barbies might have fallen for it, because that absolutely happens in real life. 

The pieces were all there, but the point still ended up somehow just being that it's okay to not know what you want and to not want to date a guy because everyone around you thinks it's what you're supposed to want. Which, once again, is something that would have been a revolutionary concept in the 00's and is now a pretty banal and basic conclusion. I feel like there was absolutely a good movie in there, but all the actual salient points got left on the cutting room floor in favor of making a toothless cash grab for a corporation that knows you want to hear it critique consumerism, but also doesn't want you to actually come away with the thought that you shouldn't buy their dolls.

Also, just as an aside, I actually hated the narration. I liked the self-aware songs a lot, but the narration was just not good and, actually, kinda pissed me off. The scene when Barbie is crying because she's just been exposed to self-consciousness for the first time and the narrator just chimes in to mock the actress for being too pretty to have self-image issues was just gross to me. Is that really the point you want to make with your feminist movie? That only ugly women are allowed to experience self doubt and beautiful women need to just shut the fuck up and be glad they're pretty?

444,"I watched this movie last night with my gf. I think the it started off pretty well. It was funny. I really enjoyed the part where they come into the real world and notice the difference. Especially Ryan discovering patriarchy was so funny.

But I felt the movie got much worse after that. I was hoping that they would be more clever about showing the struggles of women but they just went with the plain old speech. Nothing new there, everyone is familiar with that idea. The last bit of barbie turning into a human and Ruth telling her about it was just ... garbage? Why?

And every scene with the Mattel execs was just cringe. The parts where Ken couldn't help but assist/explain barbie about photoshop and finance was hilarious. Some of the scenes felt a bit too stretched out and I couldn't connect with the scene where the Ken's realize they are ""kenough"". It was not well made/written/directed imo.

I feel it would have been a lot more interesting if they showed more stuff of Barbie in the real world. Anyways, I do think a lot of other people in the theater were liking the movie. It just wasn't my kind of humor and probably not my kind of movie.

445,"I wrote this as a comment to someone regarding the contradiction in the message of this movie and was told to post it separately. Doing so with some edits so it makes sense.


In the real world, what Ken experiences is being respected for simply being who he is, which is what the Barbies experience in Barbieland all the time. Barbies in Barbieland are respected and better simply because they are Barbies (ie men in the real world). However, Ken getting treated better automatically for being a man is wrong, but it is somehow not wrong that Barbies are automatically treated better in Barbieland for being a Barbie. That's one contradiction among many this movie creates. The movie starts with the Kens in Barbieland being an allegory for women in the real world. They are struggling to find a place, respect, and autonomy in a world run by the other gender. Yes, Ken, is given respect in the real world for who he is as a man, just as Barbies, even stereotypical Barbie who has no skills is automatically given respect in Barbie world. Ken is just now experiencing what Barbies have experienced their whole lives: respect and validation. He feels better for how he is treated in the real world, that's because the Barbies have made him feel less than his whole life. But Barbie good, Ken bad. Barbie's quest is presented as one of a fight for equality and self exploration, but the Kens' fight for equality makes them the antagonists. All of this would make sense, if in the end vote, Barbie who has experienced inequality said, hey wait, things shouldn't go back to exactly how they were, because our world is one sided - just the reverse side of the same coin, and the Kens deserve a place and respect. Then the Barbies and Kens collectively moved towards eauality. However, in the end of the movie, the Kens are put back in their place with just slightly more allowences than they had before. How is that possibly a justified ending? How does that not contradict the message of the unfairness and inequality? The movie's conclusion is more focused on revenge rather than understanding and equality. The Barbies don't want equality, they want their own land to remain their own and the men to just occupy it but that's, for some reason, fine and applauded, but somehow the same thing in the real world with reversed genders is wrong. Remember the guy Ken runs into who says we still run things but just hide it better now, and we as an audience are supposed to be disgusted, but that's literally what the Barbie's do at the end: Tell the Kens to just be Ken but then hold all the power. They give a cabinet position to Weird Barbie as a ""sorry, we bullied you"" but the Kens are denied their request for one Ken on the supreme court. The Barbies needed to be above that, but they simply practice the same power hungry, shallow vindictive nature we are meant to hate in the real world. If the point is that women are still treated unfairly in our world so Kens will be treated unfairly in Barbieland, and things just practically go back to how they were, what is the point of this movie? What is the message? Barbies can unfair too? To show inequality sucks? This is not the first movie to do that. The audience for this movie already agrees that inequality is bad, yet somehow they left the movie being okay with inequality in Barbieland towards Kens. It would be fine if the movie was clever and highlighting its audience's own hypocrisy and vengeful nature, but it's not, people are leaving the movie thinking the Barbies are good and that everything was wrapped up nicely and all is good in Barbieland which is astounding.",2023-07-22 19:44:01,28,movies,ummmsomething,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

447,"Making a Barbie film, on a surface level, seems like an incredibly simplistic idea. After all, there are dozens of animated renditions of the same old stories.¬†

But what if you wanted to go further with the idea? What if you wanted to question what Barbie really was? Barbie dares to ask ‚Äúwhat is the impact of this plastic doll?‚Äù Greta Gerwig took on this tough idea, and truly went for it.¬†

As most reviews of this movie start off, I am not the target audience. I‚Äôm an 18 year old guy, what do I know about the modern woman‚Äôs experience, or Barbie dolls, or anything, really? ¬†The movie did have a tagline, ‚ÄúIf you love Barbie, if you hate Barbie, this is for you‚Äù. Well, what if you‚Äôre indifferent to Barbie?

‚ÄúBarbie‚Äù truly shines in its set design. BarbieLand is incredibly interesting to look at. It crafts a plastic world, the logical conclusion of a real world dollhouse. Even the pool isn‚Äôt real water, and it‚Äôs fun to see the two leads interact with the world in spite of its stillness.¬†

Margot Robbie plays ‚ÄúStereotypical Barbie‚Äù, and who else would you cast? The movie even pokes fun at this idea. Margot Robbie is the human Barbie. And she really leans into it in this movie. She moves and acts like a Barbie doll, down to the way she runs, and floats down from her dream house.¬†

But the gem of this film is Ryan Gosling, playing Ken. He goes all out. This is an all star performance. Ryan Gosling IS Ken. His expressions are hilarious, he is seamlessly able to make so-so jokes hilarious. His venture into and out of the patriarch idea is masterfully handled. It‚Äôs balanced enough to get laughs and make people think without ruining the positive tone of the movie.

A common criticism I‚Äôve been seeing of ‚ÄúBarbie‚Äù is Mattel‚Äôs role in the movie. Will Ferrel‚Äôs character, and the board of executives in general are somewhat of a pointless inclusion. This is mostly true. They don‚Äôt really move the plot along. They don‚Äôt do much. But in spite of this, they still manage to have some very comedic scenes. In my opinion, the movie is better for their inclusion. The ‚ÄúScooby Doo‚Äù esque chase in the Mattel building is total cartoonish fun, and a joy to watch play out on screen. ¬†And the inclusion of Mattel does give a pathway to the emotional core of the story, where Barbie meets Ruth within the offices.¬†

There are some flaws with this movie, however. The messaging is very heavy handed. This often works in the movies favor. After all, who sees ‚ÄúBarbie‚Äù for its subtlety? But it‚Äôs also often a detriment to the movie. It can occasionally come off as preachy, and often causes issues with the tone of the movie. That being said, there is a very sweet and funny scene near the end between Ken and Barbie, where you truly feel some improvement for him as a character.¬†

Some of the jokes also just don‚Äôt really land in the movie. There were jokes that just left the theater in silence. And this was a common issue in the film. I‚Äôd say half or less of the jokes truly landed.¬†

But despite these missteps, I do think the world is a better place with Greta Gerwig‚Äôs ‚ÄúBarbie‚Äù. There‚Äôs a nice heart inside this movie, and a lesson that plenty of people need to hear. its not afraid to poke fun at itself, and it‚Äôs not afraid to go for it when it feels the need to. It‚Äôs a vibrant, positive, and fun movie. The world deserves more ‚ÄúBarbie‚Äùs. P",2023-07-22 21:55:39,28,movies,,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

451,"TBH I feel like people are trying desperately to assign this movie a central message when in reality doesn't really have a clear one. Yes it is feminist, but that still leaves much room for interpterion, as feminism itself can umbrella  many other ideologies under it and still be feminist. For example some feminists believe that we should live separate of our gendered counterparts and females live amongst females and males live amongst males, while other feminists believe the exact opposite. So this movie with its main goal being a feminist and empowering movie for woman, honestly feels like an absolute mess of feminist ideologies/perspectives that are never fully explored or explained. It felt like a fever dream, clips of whatever Gerwig though would be impactful. Personally even has an AFAB person, I did not connect to this movie whatsoever. Moreover, I rarely feel the need to bend to societal expectations of gender. I never thought I was powerless, or upset with men and I feel that a lot of the emotions they tried to associate with the ""female experience"", are actually just simply the human one. The speech that the mother gave felt extremely patronising, and she tries to connect the feelings of not being good enough to woman exclusively when again those feelings are just the consequences of being in a hierarchical  society.  Am I saying that women face no oppression? And that my personal experience is the only one valid? No of course not,  but by trying to make a movie that appeals to all kinds of feminists and woman ends up saying little to nothing.

Furthermore, with the reviews I've seen, no one can come to a single conclusion about what this damn film is even about. Is about Barbie becoming her own woman and learning to feel? Is it about girls reclaiming power and believing in their own femineity? Is it about men learning to take a step back for women? Is it saying that men deserve to be put into their place for benefiting from patriarchy? I honestly have no clue myself and when I stepped out of the theatre I was left with a massive headache trying to figure out what it even meant. Even the first thought that came to my head was, ""wow that sure was an absolute nothing burger of a movie"". And I actually do enjoy media with ambiguous narratives or complex messaging, LEGIT PERFECT BLUE IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE. However with the Barbie movie, it didn't feel intentional on Gerwig's part, it felt disorganised and confused. Because with every interpretation for the Barbie movies message, can be contradicted by the movie,for example, Barbie the character was meant to explain the female experience? No but Ken represents the woman in Barbie land! Barbie is about accepting your feelings as a woman! Then why is Barbie a useless sad sack at the second half of the movie, what was she even supposed to feel, is she sad that she has cellulite now? Not every woman cares about their appearance like that. Barbie and Ken need to separate from themselves and find who they are, just like men and woman should! Main girl Barbie is the only one that does this and the Kens are still dependant on the Barbies, they are just ""Kenough"" now, yet they still don't leave the oppressive regime of the Barbies. Like what is this movie trying to comment on about the female experience? That it just sucks? That we need to rely on each other, but also need to be sperate of each other? What are you trying to say Barbie? That we need everything and nothing? Thats the female experience?

I'm sorry but I disagree, I dont think this movie adds anything to the conversation, just repeats and echos whatever is in the cultural zeitgeist of today. The female experience, or any experience for that matter cannot be defined by a single movie, my female experience will be vastly different to my moms, to my cousins, any other female commenter who reads this post. I don't feel hopeless, actually I feel more enraged that this is how I am expected to feel about my circumstances as a woman. That I have to bend my ideology and perspective to fit into whatever this movie wants to say about my life and role in society, that I have to relate to Barbie or Ken or whoever character was meant to represent the females in society. This movie is just an arthouse version of a corporate movie to make Mattel seem progressive, but by making Barbie seem to be the very first Fashion doll for girls, is already erasing so much female history. I am not going to explain it all, but there are multiple doll makers before barbie, and an excelent video that explains it is Mjtanners ""How Mattel Rewrote History To Put Barbie On Top"". Anyway, I just dont like this movie, its lack of actual concrete message, and how it panders to capitalistic fodder.

I can also name 3 other projects that capture the female experience much better than Barbie could

452,"It wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. 

I missed out on the movie goer experience (busy with work) but it looked like it made such an impact on so many people online that I was really gearing myself up for a cry fest.

It felt like a kids movie lol. Which like - duh. It's *Barbie.* But the way so many people out there were just piling on accolades - I guess I thought it'd be more complex than it was. 

It's probably because most films don't have the characters just straight out say ""this is what I mean"" but it felt very odd to have every character be as cartoon-ishly stereotypical as possible.

It was a cute little movie and has a lot of nostalgia attached to it but I don't think it should have garnered the title of ""highest grossing film of 2023"" tbh.",2023-12-17 16:14:46,28,movies,Songbir8,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

456,"I absolutely loved this movie. I was a bit put off by the opening sequence, but after 5 to 10 minutes of weirdness I leaned into the whole absurdist vibe and started to really enjoy myself. The over-the-top hyper-feminine perfection of BarbieLand, the tongue in cheek narration and musical score, the sheer goofiiness of the Kens that capture the ""just guys being dudes"" attitude in the best way I've ever seen on television. Yeah, the plot doesn't make sense, but who cares? It's no more absurd than the latest Marvel capeshit and is a perfectly acceptable excuse to tell a funny story about female emancipation.

I thought the monologue that everyone loves to quote was a bit preachy and over the top (it is not ""literally impossible"" to be a woman) and only served as a disservice to the film's message, and the Ruth / Barbie conversation about how to be human was a bit dragged out which sort of left me feeling that the real movie ended about 10 minutes before the credits rolled, but other than that I thoroughly enjoyed myself.",2023-07-31 15:04:59,27,movies,mfunebre,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

467,"Something about Barbie sitting with the old lady at the bench really got to me.

Barbie calling her beautiful and the old lady responding with ‚ÄúI know‚Äù was such a fun moment with so much emotional substance underneath.

I felt like Barbie at that moment recognized this is a real woman who has changed and has lived a full life, it‚Äôs just a stark contrast to Barbie who is destined to never change who practically relives the same day everyday, someone who fears changes because it goes against what she is (cellulite, her feet falling flat, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm supposed to be stereotypical Barbie‚Äù, etc.)

And Barbie recognizes this contrast, but for the first time ever she doesn‚Äôt despise the effects of change, she recognizes how much of a privilege it is to grow and be a person, so she ultimately whispers a small ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so beautiful‚Äù at the grandma

469,"Saw it last night... and I'm still confused this morning. The first half was utterly amazing. Wonderful, surreal, hilarious. And then... I don't know. It just started to lose it's way. There was still some great stuff in there, but it wasn't firing on all cylinders any more.

While I loved the monologue, there were some bits after that where I felt like they were hitting me over the head with ""the message"" (when at the start it was wonderfully interwoven and comically done). Ken's character arc was more eventful and interesting than Barbie's when you really boil it down, and yet his revelations at the end were just dismissed, while Barbie's ending... urgh. I know people will disagree with me here, so I'm waiting for the downvotes, but having her choose to go to the real world felt really wrong! 

I loved when she and Ken went there he was having a great time and she was trying to describe strange feelings - automatic feelings - that she'd never had before, like anxiety, fear  etc. (Interestingly my husband didn't get this at all and I had to explain how most/all women genuinely do feel like that most of the time. He looked a bit shocked). Then the daughter telling her everyone hates Barbie and what she represents (that would have been me btw, I hated Barbie when I was young for all the reasons she says!). It's clear the real world is the real world we know - a hard place for women. But at the end when she says she'd like to go live in the real world, it's never really explained why she would want to, and then Ruth says she can't in good conscience let her go without showing her what it's really like... before filling her head with ""female perfection"" - all laughter and sunshine and happy families. That's not what it's really like. Ruth conned her! Given the subversive nature of the rest of the film I expected Ruth to show her what it was really like - periods, pregnancy, abortion issues, lower wages, abuse, sexism, healthcare, menopause - and for Barbie to say you know what? No thanks. I'll stay where I am and keep improving Barbieland. Like the scene with Weird Barbie (who I \*loved\*) and the shoes. The fact it ended with her in a GYN's office just felt like a bad joke, and I didn't know if it was meant to be a bad joke - haha Barbie you think the real world is so great, welcome to the hell that is being a woman. 

I think the film was trying to show that a matriarchy can be just as bad as a patriarchy, and it did that really well at the beginning, but not well at the end. I suspect that was intentional, but it ended up being messy and vague. 

And lastly, I knew nothing about the history of Barbie before seeing this film, but I read a couple of articles beforehand and had a newfound respect for the doll because other dolls were babies to made girls want to be mothers (like the film hilariously points out), and Barbie never had kids because she's supposed to be whatever she wants to be. While I never realised  before, and which I really liked! But then Gloria's big idea was to make an ""everyday Barbie"" who was a mum. And Ruth showed Barbie ""happy family"" type images. Why not show happy women doing other things? Their own things? Isn't that what Barbie was supposed to be? I found that message pretty disappointing.

He was able to make jokes that weren't even that funny work due to his charisma and comedic timing, plus his emotional scenes at the end were so well done. Margot did a very good job as Barbie but I feel we didn't get to spend more time with her. Although I'll admit her final scene with Ruth was very touching. 
The mother daughter duo fell flat for me, as well as the Mattel execs who in all honesty didn't need to be in the film since they didn't really do anything substantial.
 
It's a visually stunning film and I really love the set design of Barbieland as well as the different Barbies & Kens. But the script needed to be tightened up in places.",2023-08-03 21:38:18,27,movies,JunebugAsiimwe,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

Edit: I should clarify I meant Villain like ""Antagonist"", not as in he's evil.

Ken is pretty much never the antagonist and is always on Barbie's side in basically any Barbie media outside of movie's like Greta Gerwig's Barbie or Toy Story 3.",2023-07-21 13:07:22,26,movies,King_Beryl,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
490,"Saw it for a second time last night, I was still a wreck by the end. Anyone with mommy issues knows what I mean.

I also didn't appreciate the initial wave of user reviews that were upset/critical about Ken becoming an incel/misogynist. I think it perfectly captures how many young boys perceive the world through the lens of being a ""high-value male"" after feeling that they only exist for the gaze of a woman in their adolescent years, especially now with dickheads like Andrew Tate spoon-feeding them rat poison. I think it could have been delved into more, but I appreciated the line from Margot Robbie about finding out who you are without being attached to another person, by proxy of removing the ""It's X and Y"" and replacing it with ""It's X **and** it's Y!"" Just really a fan of self-empowerment to help people make better relationships without being codependent on one another for validation.

Will Ferrell is also hilarious comic relief as a parody of ""woke"" brands. By woke I mean the let's slap a rainbow on the logo for June and then keep donating to anti-LGBT groups version of woke.

493," I'm kind of surprised at the amount of people who enjoyed it. Don't get me wrong, it was fun to watch! The acting, costumes, set and music were all incredible. The story on the other hand, made no flippin sense. I was REALLY disappointed when the movie turned into a ""boys vs girls"". I didn't understand why the writers chose to pivot away from the original plot of ""finding the girl who is sad and helping her"" to making Ken the villain. 

Where it started to fall apart for me was when Barbie finds Sasha in the real world. Sasha makes a valid point that stereotypical barbie is an unrealistic example of a woman and puts too much pressure on little girls. But the thing is that Barbieland is FILLED WITH non-stereotypical barbies! And none of the criticisms that Sasha mentions are really addressed in the film. The film just pivots to barbies vs Kens and forgets the mother-daughter relationship it was trying to repair. Not to mention the ending made NO SENSE!

I think the movie would have been better if the focus was on that original problem: that barbies don't look like every little girl or boy. The film would have been better if at the start of the film, every barbie was a stereotypical barbie. And after barbie visits the real world, experiences the sexism and misogyny and sees the undue pressures her image is causing if she somehow helped Sasha accept herself or took her back to barbieland to help her change the stereotypical barbies into unique barbies. The same plot of Mattel trying to stop barbie could have been left in, and in the end Mattel could have seen that unique barbies/kens were selling better than stereotypical ones, thus advertising Mattel's actual changes to the barbie brand.

But that's just me.",2023-07-26 02:53:09,26,movies,Ok_World_7653,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
494,"I liked a lot of this movie... it's well made, the music, the set pieces, the edit is all great... however the heavy handed girls have it harder than boys is there when it doesn't need to be. It basically ends that men will not get a say in Barbieland so long as women don't get a say in the real world, but.. half the real world supreme court justices are women, the Vice President is a woman. Women are increasingly dominating corporate executive positions in many companies, including my own. It really misses the we're all in this together no matter the gender part. It's not a war.  My point is emphasized by the fact that his was THE biggest movie of the year. 

Now, I think they're just constantly on the edge of saying that with Ken, but they really just don't ever deliver on it. They portray things like doing Duolingo, managing finances, and expressing passion for old movies as some sort of irredemable sin. 

More than half of people in college are women... and now there is basically a crisis where men aren't going to school and becoming polarized to the point where their identity has become Trumpism. Let's not act like men have no emotions, or social intelligence, and should just be subservient because a jaded woman says so. The real world mom's monologue on this was just a take on humans, not just women. The movie was clearly written by a woman (in the same vain that female characters in movies written by men are way off). It's just reversing the roles. 

But like I said at the beginning, it's still well made and fun. Made me laugh more than any other movie this year. Maybe this movie is more for the world rather than for California kids like myself.",2023-12-24 08:06:54,26,movies,Richandler,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

Every idea this movie has about patriarchy, the male gaze, female objectification, toxic masculinity, etc, is presented in the first scene on the beach in LA, yet the movie still spends the next hour constantly repeating the same thing over and over and over. It never adds any new wrinkles, or works its ideas into the story in an interesting way. It just beats you over the head again and again. By the time we got to the mother's monologue, I couldn't help but roll my eyes.

498,"I found it really average :/ Would give it 6/10. My friend and I left the theater agreeing that it was fun but we wouldn't go see it again. 

I thought it was funny for the most part, but I'm not seeing where or how it touched so many people. To see reviews saying they cried or Barbie nailed how it felt to be a woman was weird cuz I didn't feel that way at all as a woman. I also don't get the praise for America Ferrera's character.I feel like they didn't flesh her out at all or her daughter. They don't explain why shes having thoughts of death and depression. They kind of brush it off with her saying shes weird and dark, but those sound kind of serious so I thought there would be a story there. Even her daughter they introduce her as this queen of mean that Barbie is warned about but never follow up on that... So I guess shes just mean because she's a teenager? Like the characters have no motivation. They are just plot devices so Barbie interacts in the human world and so they can help deprogram the other Barbies. 

Then honestly, it wasn't super woke. I will say it got awkward and too on the nose somewhere in the middle. It just became word salad about patriarchy and being a women. It made me roll my eyes. I think they were already hitting on the point by being funny and just telling the story like earlier in the movie. Even so, I wouldn't describe it as this feminist weapon against men. Just slightly annoying with the not subtle social commentary. Then, the rest of the movie is just for laughs. My favorite character was Ken honestly.

507,"I would just like to say that I think people calling the film anti-man are completely wrong and genuinely fail to understand the basic content of this movie. 

Kens are not human men. the only human men portrayed in this movie other than the dad, who is adorable but not part of the plot, are a satire of the REALITY of the inequality, misogyny, and discrimination in the corporations that profit off women. 

here's a question for anyone who thinks the film is promoting misandry: do you even believe that women face discrimination in the real world? that we have it harder than men? 

do you know or believe anything about the reality of being a woman under patriarchy? 

are you even able to imagine not being treated like a man?",2023-07-26 22:15:37,26,movies,quietanaphora,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
508,"Going against the grain here, I actually loved barbie! I feel like it appealed to women and girls of all ages which I loved. As far as people complaining about how ‚Äúbasic‚Äù some of the feminist themes were, it‚Äôs a movie about a toy, it doesn‚Äôt exactly have a target audience of feminist scholars. I think it was witty, original, and really captured the overall essence of womanhood pretty well.

509,"I saw it today after seeings snippets and social hype since the release. It was just okay. I thought I was gonna be wowed by the way people talked about it. The first half was great but I felt the message was a little too chaotic and trying really hard to be deep. 

I actually listened and watched billi Elishes music video and song prior to the movie. Her work was actually way better than the movie I have to say. Her 3 min video was so powerful and made me cry. I got it almost instantly. Barbie on the other hand was really into using the stereotypical feminist jargon and said patriarchy way too much. I‚Äôm a feminist but I just didn‚Äôt really think half the movie was needed to drive home the point.

To me, the Ken scenes were boring. I didn‚Äôt care for the music it was like suddenly a musical? The Mattel ceo scenes were funny the first time but their repeated interactions weren‚Äôt needed. 

What I felt was missing was the connection to the mother daughter duo. Understanding their issues and their struggles. Greenblatt is a beautiful young actress but her cast as the teen daughter was not my favorite choice. I wish they had chosen a teen girl that is a bit more‚Ä¶average looking to drive home some of the themes on vanity and coming of age. She looks like a Hollywood actress‚Ä¶not an avg 14 year old. It pulled me from the story tbh especially when she made the speech to Barbie about insecurity. 

I was anticipating the ending having seen the trailer and the social media clips however it wasn‚Äôt as fleshed out as I thought. It seems they pulled a storyline directly from Lois Lowrys ‚Äúthe giver‚Äù added feminism and called it a day, yet there was a depth of the story that was Insinuated but missing from Barbie. The take my hands bit wasn‚Äôt as powerful as I thought and I‚Äôm a sucker for sappy scenes. I didn‚Äôt cry like everyone predicted I would. I honestly still don‚Äôt understand what all these women are referring to when they say the movie healed them? 

I think it was fun and the costume and set designer should win the awards here. Margot Robbie was also a fabulous Barbie. But the story fell flat. Had been just a fun Barbie story without the depth I think it would been okay too but I felt they were trying  to make a point for too many topics that it was a bit chaotic. 

Not terrible but I still think Billie Ellishs take on Barbie was way better. Just my opinion though I‚Äôd probably watch again.",2023-08-09 13:20:16,26,movies,Toesblue,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
510,"I saw it last night and I'm glad I wasn't the only one who thought the message was muddled. I got the impression we were supposed to be rooting for the Kens, until the ending. A sentence I've read in countless feminist articles is ""loss of privilege can feel like oppression"", which I figured was the point. It was an allegory for the real world, until it wasn't. It seemed like it would have been an easy home run to have Barbieland becoming an egalitarian society and acknowledging that both the real world and Barbieland treated *both* sexes unfairly in different ways. Instead, during the climax, did Gerwig *want* us to root for the Barbies -- the ""oppressors"" -- over the downtrodden Kens? It lost me there. Maybe they shouldn't have made Ken so likeable.

It felt like they wanted the Kens to represent both Andrew Tate's brand of ""red-pilled"" ""masculinity"", so we had a villain to root against, *and* an allegory for women prior to having many rights and freedoms. So how does that work?

Also, during the whole ""Ken discovers patriarchy"" scene, as funny as that was, they made some weird choices. Some of their depictions of patriarchy were just men playing sports and Sylvester Stallone in various fashionable outfits (which you'd think Ken would already have in Barbieland). If it was Stallone during Rambo 2 or even the end of Rocky 4, I'd get it, but I don't get how ""men existing and doing things"" is patriarchal. I do get that the idea was that patriarchy makes Ken feel validated in a way that he never had before but if patriarchy is supposed to be the villain to be defeated, maybe I shouldn't have been thinking ""aw, look at how accepted patriarchy is making Ken feel! Good for you, Ken!"" Dismantling patriarchy and smashing the patriarchy are often touted as feminism's goals but the movie presents it being beneficial in some ways.",2023-07-22 16:26:42,26,movies,Prefer_Not_To_Say,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
511,"I don't get why everyone loves it. The jokes weren't funny, it was too preachy, and the story was awful. Like why did it have to be all dark and sad? And the story is that there's the Barbie world that's like when kids play with Barbies, but also they can cross over to the real world, but also the company is aware that they're real and humans can enter the Barbie world, but then Ken brings back the patriarchy like it's a disease and Barbie doesn't actually like Ken. Greta Gerwig had the chance to make some changes to the Barbie lore and she decided we should know Barbie is not actually into Ken? Why do there? I'm not saying everyone needs a love interest, but why break up an established couple? Did we really need that lesson about finding yourself outside of relationships from Barbie and Ken? Did we have a problem with Barbie and Ken being a couple?

Maybe what I disliked the most was how they painted their brand as if the Barbies ""believe they've fixed feminism and made everything perfect for women"". Who here, before seeing this movie, thought of Barbie as a brand that believes it fixed feminism and made the lives of women better? Not me. They're like ""oh we're so naive and well-intentioned, we thought we did great for women and girls, but in this movie we acknowledge that in fact our brand isn't that perfect"". But I'm just like ""no, I never thought you were naive and well-intended and trying to save girls, I always thought you were just trying to make money"".",2023-07-22 10:10:33,26,movies,purplenelly,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
512,"This was a very fun movie and I really enjoyed it. However, it didn't really leave an emotional impact for me. I felt like They were attempting to do way too much in terms of social commentary that it got in the way of the storyline. There were plot points that I feel like were either underdeveloped or just dropped entirely. 

For example, the relationship between mother daughter felt underdeveloped. Why is there conflict between them? what was the mother going through that it lead to her drawing Barbie with thoughts of death? I don't really understand their motivations as characters because we barely spend time with them. We get a little flashback through Barbie and that's it. So when the climax came and she was making a big speech it didn't feel earned because I barely knew anything about her (I don't even remember her name). It also did not make any sense that her speech was what cured the brainwashing because the Barbie's wouldn't really relate to what she's saying because they haven't experienced the real world (at the beginning Barbie did not even understand the concept of catcalling).

The mattel storyline led nowhere as well. There was literally no reason for them to go to Barbieland. It felt like they wanted to do social commentary on capitalism but also weren't able to fully commit to making mattel the villain, so why include it in the first place? What was this super bad thing that was going to happen if Barbie stayed in the real word which led to the chase scene. They also mentioned it happening before (with skipper) that led to bad consequences but never mentioned it again. However, in the end it was suddenly totally fine for Barbie to be in the real world? Maybe because she was a human now, but it was still kind of confusing. 

I also felt like her decision to be human at the end wasn't set-up properly. When she was in Barbieland she never showed discontentment about her life. In fact, when weird Barbie was making her choose (matrix style), she'd rather not know. This would've been fine if she experienced something that warrants her changing her perspective but there was literally nothing good that happened to her in the real world. There was no motivation for her to be human. Although, the idea was that barbie (and by extension the viewers) can be whatever they want is good, I think it could've been better if there was motivation behind her decision.

I also felt bad for the kens as they were essentially at the same place they started.

I know that not every movie should be analyzed scene by scene and you should just enjoy the movie for what it is. These are just some of my thoughts. I still enjoyed the movie overall.",2023-07-22 21:53:13,26,movies,Which-Chapter5990,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

515,"So my bias is that I‚Äôm an adult woman who loved Barbie as a kid, had a feminist mother who didn‚Äôt want me to love Barbie as a kid, went through the ‚Äúnot like other girls‚Äù internalized misogyny phase as a tween, and circled back to embracing my femininity including an interest in Barbie and knowing quite a bit about Barbie lore as an adult. 


This movie was so great. 


I saw it in a local theatre that had a costume contest beforehand, it was such a happy sight to see almost an entire theatre, men and women, smiling and wearing pink. Immaculate vibes. 


Perhaps, given that, it dilutes a bit of the laughter relative to a more general audience in a more conventional venue, but the comedy genuinely seemed to land throughout and I personally laughed a lot as well. As someone who knew about gaffes such as Pregnant Midge and Earring Magic Ken going in, I probably got more out of some of the jokes than the uninitiated, but I also don‚Äôt think it was so esoteric as to be inaccessible. 


I think this movie works because Greta Gerwig clearly loves Barbie and has also grappled with the problems Barbie represents. The introduction to Barbieland was very true to the way my friends and I played with Barbie dolls as kids and I felt that same recognition from other women in the audience. The tween character‚Äôs takedown of Barbie was very true to the anger I felt at that age; starting to be sexualized because my body was developing while simultaneously being bullied for my acne, resenting movie stars and fictional representations of women such as Barbie who were perfect-looking and who I perceived not having to struggle with self-image. 


It‚Äôs funny to me how the crux of most of the criticism I‚Äôve seen so far centers on America Ferrera‚Äôs monologue about the lose-lose situations women are expected to contend with, because it so mirrors the discourse. Some critics are saying it‚Äôs too on-the-nose with its feminism, while others are saying it didn‚Äôt do enough. Some are saying the treatment of Ken is misandrist, some are saying it didn‚Äôt go far enough and it needed to provide real-world solutions to empower women more. To me, Ken was quite a likable character and it made sense to me that when he saw how much better he was treated in the real world he would want to hold onto that, because that‚Äôs kind of how I felt watching Barbieland in the beginning. I would love to know what it‚Äôs like to have a female president and all-female Supreme Court. I would love to move through the world without being sexualized. I felt that Barbie did realize her privilege in Barbieland and I liked the compromise she made with Ken, but I can see from some of the reviews that didn‚Äôt work for everybody. 


Lastly, people are already predicting that the success of Barbie is going to lead to a lot of lesser-quality toy-centric movies and that probably will prove true. In that vein, I find myself comparing Barbie to The Lego Movie because I think these are the two that work, and they represent the standard any others should be judged by. Both were made by people who had a lot of passion about them and a strong vision for them. The meta elements each one used to represent how children played with each toy were tailored to the subject of their respective movies and I liked that the plots were not interchangeable in this regard. Of course people of all ages enjoy Legos but I think the age of the child in The Lego Movie was chosen well, you get the sense his imagination has not been hindered by adolescence yet but he was mature enough to communicate with his father about wanting a closer bond. Likewise, I noticed Barbie really didn‚Äôt include any very little girls apart from the 2001 gag, and they chose to focus on a tween who had already outgrown Barbie dolls and her mother who missed playing with them together. In my opinion, this was smart not only because it‚Äôs a PG-13 movie and not really targeted at children, but also because the way women are socialized I think a lot of us do go through distinct phases of enthusiastically adhering to stereotypical femininity in childhood, rejecting femininity in adolescence, and finding balance in adulthood that can only be achieved with the benefit of hindsight and the effort of self-reflection.",2023-07-22 12:51:54,26,movies,sagetcommabob,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
516,"Overall I think the movie was good with some heavy-handed themes and messages but that doesn't diminish the movie at all.   
I think the ending would have been far better if it had stuck to one concise message. Instead it jumped around to a message about >!Ken being his own person, then toxic masculinity, then it cut to the Mattel CEO and he said something (I forgot what he said to be honest since he really added nothing to the scene), to President Barbie saying that the world needs to change, then to President Barbie saying that the Kens still aren't going to be given any positions of power in the movie, and finally to Barbie wanting to become human!<. I personally just think that instead of addressing 5 to 6 messages half-heartedly the movie should have stuck to 1 or 2 that it could have addressed fully and thoroughly. 

>!I also think it's very weird that Barbie is so invested in saving the Barbie world from the Patriarchy but then goes into the real world where there is a far more oppressive and serious patriarchy. Maybe if there was a line about her wanting to go to the real world to empower women it would have made more sense. !<",2023-07-24 21:56:41,26,movies,Creepyfern2223,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

532,"There's such an energy around this movie! Not just on screen but around it too. It's so much fun going to a theatre and people are dressed up in pink, having a good time. Films are back baby! And I love when people can rally about a movie that is 'actually good' tm (c) !!!

And this is actually good! For real! 

One part ELF, one part Pleasantville, throw in some lego movie and then sprinkle some pink on it and we've got a good fucking time. Really silly and self aware, and brave in a lot of ways. It's not afraid to make fun of itself and kudos to Mattel for being a brand brave enough to face their criticisms head on (even if overall, it's a commercial for the doll and the new direction they're heading towards). I think it has an incredible message about female empowerment and living life on your own terms, not the way our male centric society decides you too. BUT, also it's speaking to men and it's trying to bridge the gap between our genders and foster some understanding, for everyone. I think some people will see this as vessel to make fun of men but these people are dumb lol. It's okay be poked fun of guys, just like it's still okay to like horses. They're very manly, very cool. I found the whole concept of  Ken going to the real world and seeing how much men control and getting a bit power hungry because of that so smart. It's a really clever plot device to bring some conflict into the movie. 

From a filmmaking standpoint I was most impressed with the art direction, obviously! The sets and costumes are incredible and I'm sure were a labour of love. Just give the movie all the oscars in that regard. Huge achievement and just nailed the look of a larger than life Barbie world. I was also impressed with the music, lot of jams and the movie is like pretty much a musical at times? And a good one at that. 

I think the whole cast was great, Michael Cera as Alan killed! Margot Robbie was exceptional in the title role. BUT, Gosling steals the show here. His character could've been really over the top and not in a good way.It's a really fine line and Gosling just handles it perfectly. An iconic comedic performance and one that will just shut up any doubter that he wasn't right for this role. The dude kills it and I'm so proud he's Canadian! It is a little ironic that a film about Barbie and female empowerment is a little overshadowed at times by his performance. I feel a little conflicted about this, but you can't deny that he's probably the best thing about this movie. That Just Ken song rips. 

I think the movie is at its best when it's slowed down and introspective. When we see Barbie take a moment to just experience life and her new feelings, It's very beautiful. The movie doesn't work for me in the moments it's trying to be a Chevrolet commercial (yes you read that right, the most forced product placement in a movie about a product). I also understand the mother and daughter's purpose in the plot of the film. BUT, I just felt them tacked on and unneeded and the daughter  was not a particularly good actress painful to say. The Mattel executives too felt like an after thought and not very important or funny (sorry Will Ferrell ). 

LOTS to talk about and I'll get even more from subsequent viewings. I think this movie really speaks to women and I love that. People are so stoked on this and I had a blast too. While not an exactly original IP, it is an original story and the studios need to see that good, unique films get people excited.

535,"Barbie Barbie Barbie.

I really didn‚Äôt get the point of the movie. It felt like they had a bunch of good ideas that couldn‚Äôt  develop enough in the time allotted. Pardon the pun, but it made the movie feel plastic. 

Theme 1: Barbie discovering she‚Äôs a toy/ someone is making her feel this way (so who is playing with Ken??)

Theme 2: becoming okay with not being perfect/ becoming human 

Theme 3: Barbie land matriarchy vs real world patriarchy

Theme 3: Ken not feeling satisfied with life (mirroring women‚Äôs experience in the real world) and then finally being ‚ÄúKenough‚Äù. But he still doesn‚Äôt get his own house, or a better relationship with Barbie, or anything other than what he already had‚Ä¶ this feels like the opposite of feminism. (Also, there was nothing about normalizing boys playing with dolls, and I‚Äôm super disappointed)

Theme 4: mother/daughter relationship issues (I felt both their roles were written very shallow even with the big ‚Äúah ha‚Äù speech from the mom).

Theme 5: mother is having thoughts of suicide/existential crisis which leads Barbie to have these thoughts and cellulite? Umm, what?

Theme 6: weird Barbie not being accepted by the other Barbies. And pregnant Barbie! (So many missed opportunities with this for character development!)

I personally think this film is sad. I didn‚Äôt feel happy  or delighted after the film. For me personally it shows that both worlds are not perfect - they are perfect either JUST for Kens/men or JUST for Barbies/women. Kens didn‚Äôt know other way then just become basically Barbies excluding them. And at the end it‚Äôs all staying the same in both worlds with a little hope however. But still both worlds remained imperfect and seemingly unchanged. Still no balance found. 

Like in the past women were seen as with no interests, other then to please men, same goes with Kens. Ken was exited that he can read about horses, and linked it to patriarchy, because he wasn‚Äôt allowed to have any interests in the Barbieland. 

I disagree that this film is anti-male. You expect that CEO is a bad guy, but he‚Äôs just ok, he‚Äôs just doing his job and has some good motives. When Kens fought they ended up supporting each other. Yet I would love to see how the patriarchy affects men in negative way as well (basically also being perfect, on the top, not expressing emotions, loneliness, etc), and also to show that some Barbies would gladly be with Kens (it did show it at end but briefly, it was not enough for me) that being a powerful woman doesn‚Äôt exclude being with the man if she wants it, and that being a powerful Ken is totally okay too. But at least it showed that if you‚Äôre a man and are not on the top it‚Äôs okay too. 

Alan was a great guy because he was the only person who was balanced, he was happy where he is, was just minding his own business and when everything went wrong he was just done with everything. He was the only guy who was supporting Barbie while still being kenough. 

But I wanted to escape reality with this film. But  there‚Äôs no fairytale, just (bitter) reality.",2023-07-21 22:52:32,25,movies,ShortLeggedJeans,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

539,"This movie was quite odd, all in all. I really liked the humor (the prologue already had me laughing out loud) and the performances (the dance numbers were very good).

In terms of the movie‚Äôs message, I think it‚Äôs a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, the movie points out the fact that barbie in many ways commercializes unrealistic standards of beauty and accomplishments, and it criticizes commercialization of mental health. On the other hand, the movie is itself obviously an ad, pointing out all the different barbie products through the ages and giving random bits of trivia about the company (like the fact that barbie was named after the inventor‚Äôs daughter. That sounded like it could have come straight from a barbie website).

On the one hand, the central conflict somewhat acknowledges the struggles of incel-y men and urges Ken to find his own path. On the other hand it sends really wonky messaging regarding how the men were treated (e.g. no one ever tried to de-indoctrinate the men of Ken-dom; the only reason why the vote worked was due to tricking the men into not voting).

I think this is a bit of a missed opportunity, because I liked the way it portrayed women's struggles and it would be possible to write a movie that shows why the patriarchy is bad for both men and women. For women it‚Äôs obvious; for men the problems lie in extremely high pressure to be sexually successful, to support a family on their own, no tolerance for their emotions and no mercy for those men not adhering to the ideal. But instead, the movie doesn‚Äôt really make a convincing argument why the Kens should also oppose patriarchy (which I as a man certainly think they should).

I guess a fantasy dream land is kind of a weird place to make political commentary on anyway, since there is no scarcity of resources, no actual consequences from authoritarian leadership (such as cut abortion rights), no domestic violence or anything like that. The idea of restoring the women to their autonomy by de-programming them was kind of laughable anyway, since they didn‚Äôt have any autonomy in the first place, they were literally caricature dolls that partied all day and never worried about anything profound. So the movie didn‚Äôt really make me feel like the conflict mattered or made sense.

It was a fun watch, but I‚Äôll probably forget about it soon.",2023-07-21 22:04:23,25,movies,Krylos,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

541,"I know the film wouldn‚Äôt have been made without it, but the Mattel inclusion held this film back. It really lost the story at one point because of it, but Greta did a phenomenal job at making a film that excelled despite this hinderance and we really saw her range here. The scene with Barbie sat on the bench in the park was so beautiful, along with the ending, but we also saw her satirical, comedy chops at show - I loved the depressed Barbie commercial. Obviously Ryan Gosling steals the movie with his perfect comedic timing and his OTT performance. I think the beach-off/dance scene was the stand out. 

I really didn‚Äôt expect to shed a tear watching this. I‚Äôve still got Oppenheimer to watch, but to the people saving Barbie for second are going to get a big surprise if they want to end their night on a happy note.

But he just feels he should do it because he sees others doing it and he‚Äôs empty on the inside. This is a great movie not just for little  girls, but also for young boys and even grown men.

Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are great in this. My fellow USC alum, Will Ferrell is funny as always, and the comedy just clicked. A great watch.

547,"A couple of things that bother me about this movie - after seeing all the Kens portrayed as stupid and the real world patriarchy portrayed as buffoonish morons, we get the scene with Gloria‚Äôs husband where he‚Äôs mocked for learning a language by his daughter and wife - then again later when Gloria is driving she mentions/implies a older cooler boyfriend than her husband taught her to drive. It‚Äôs a small thing but it‚Äôs just shows where the writers head was at, that even when there‚Äôs zero narrative purpose for it, the male characters exist to be mocked and shown as losers who their female counterparts aren‚Äôt really into.

Another point is the scene where Ken is crying - Barbie is telling him it‚Äôs alright to cry and the movie seems to be trying to send the message that it‚Äôs alright for men to cry and not be ‚Äútoxic‚Äù, and yet - the scene is played partly for laughs. Contrast that with Barbies crying scene which is show seriously and as a sympathetic tender moment.

So Gerwigs movie is contradicting its own point. It‚Äôs alright for men to cry, but men crying is also funny and a subject of comedy to her. (There‚Äôs even a funny song where Ken sings about his fragility). So which is it? Is it alright for men to cry or is it high humour when they do? Does Gerwig herself know or understand the contraction in her narrative choices for this movie?
I just find that aspect of the movie is really unintentionally representative of feminist confusion/hypocrisy.",2023-07-31 11:27:52,25,movies,NutSackforDayzzzz,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
548,"It was mid. \[spoilers\]

I wanted the storyline to be something a bit more exciting while still keeping the morale of the story (for example, Barbie became depressed, or loss a loved one, etc.) The climax was honestly anti-climatic and there was no true turning point in the movie that gave it that ""wow"" factor. Everything was predictable/non-reactive. On top of that, the morale of the story was kind of unclear/distractive. Like, I know it teaches us about equality and the male dominant world, however they also sprinkled in bits of ""barbie destroyed kids images of themselves"" and ""barbie thinks about death"" and ""barbie doesn't feel like she has a purpose"",,, all of which didn't fit the morale of the story and never really got resolved/explained.

The fact that she became a human confused me the most... like okay, she wants to become the creator not the idea, so what? am I dense or does that have nothing to do with the previous conflicts I've mentioned? What does becoming human have to do with equality, or women never feeling like they're enough, or thinking about death???

Ultimately they touched on too many things at once, thus making the morale of the story a little unclear/distractive. They introduced too many morale's that they couldn't fully address/finish. It was not really happy nor deeply depressive... It was a weird middle where they wanted to portray ""deep"" messages but were limited due to the PG nature of the movie...

Then the movie ends with her apologizing to Ken? For what? Not being interested in him? I might be misremembering but she was never directly mean to him except for when he kept pushing for a romantic relationship. 

Also the idea that Ruth Handler is a feminist icon is kind of laughable. She was a capitalist who saw an adult novelty toy for men (Bild Lilli) and said to herself ""I bet little girls want to play with this."" When her ghost or whatever talks to Barbie my eyes almost rolled out of my head.

560,"I'm very sceptical about this movie. It has conflicted with a lot of philosophical and political ideas I keep and I'm not really sure it's a net positive for societal norms. 

My first point of scepticism is the ending. If feminism is about equality between the sexes, and this movie wants to be a clear proponent of feminism why end it with the Barbies in control once again? I feel like the movie has disingenuous intentions to the viewer here, where it starts off trying to take an ethical stance and advocate for the correct behaviours but then flips it all on its head where the ""happily ever after"" scenario ends up being one of the sexes over another. Division between the sexes shouldn't even be a thing here - we are all human and our differences and disagreements are solved through understanding, not spitefulness. It's not ""because guys are in control in the real world, we will be in control here"" it should be ""because guys are in control in the real world, we will show them we can do better here, and build a society equal for all"".

Second thing was the way Barbies emotionally manipulated the Kens against each other. As much as Kens were clearly acting wrong in their patriarchical society (as indicated in the movie plenty of times), It felt as if the retaliation by the Barbies was also wrong -  exploiting their feelings of love to achieve their end goal. However, absolutely zero reference was given that this behaviour was incorrect in retrospect. My concern is that younger people see this and start thinking that it's ok to play these kinds of games to get what they want from others. In the end what Barbie did, telling Ken how she truly felt about him after he was also honest about his feelings IS the proper way to go about things, but I take issue that the exploitation of the Kens was passed off in a neutral to positive light, and hasn't been criticized more.

I had several other facepalms throughout the movie that were less important e.g. the fact that Ruth in wanting to prepare/warn Barbie for the difficulties that lie ahead in her new life as a human, shows her images of laughing people and pure joy, no suffering or pain whatsoever. Felt like the writers lost a good opportunity to tell the audience that life cannot be all rainbows and sunshine's all the time, and you just have to endure and persevere sometimes. Maybe these aren't worth mentioning that much though.

Overall felt like the movie had potential to be something great but ended up confused in its messages. I did appreciate Barbies and Ken's identity crises and how they navigated through them, eventually helping each other and building a true bond that transcends sex, but looking at the movie as a whole, feels like it does more harm than good, and it kinda annoys me",2023-08-21 01:11:42,24,movies,CourageousFighter,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

The one thing I kinda thought was forced was America's brief speech about all the contradictions women face in a society.

I think it does a good job of showing you that patriarchy is bad for EVERYONE. Barbie obviously had it rough when she goes into the real world and sees that it's not the same as Barbie land and has a crisis when she learns of all the things women have to go through and how hard we have it (being sexually assaulted and objectified within minutes of arriving in the Real World and then being arrested for defending herself when that one guy slaps her arse. Even the police at the station were objectifying her and brushing off her very real and very upsetting experience that nearly every single woman will have gone through at some point in their life and somehow they're blamed for wearing something too revealing or leading a man on, or being too drunk...). Meanwhile, Ken lands in the real world and is immediately given the respect he's been missing in Barbie Land. And so he's brainwashed into thinking the Patriarchy is the best thing ever and just goes along with it even though he doesn't really understand it.

Since the beginning of big box-office mega movies, the vast majority of these movies have been targeted towards men, especially those based off of IP. I‚Äôm thinking Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, LOTR, Transformers, etc. Now comes a huge movie that is about women, focuses specifically on female nostalgia, is directed by a female, is aesthetically eye catching and unabashedly feminine, besides looking fun, funny, and well done (which other people have noted in comments). The appeal and ‚Äúhype‚Äù apparently seems to shock and baffle many people on and off this platform. Women make up more than half of the population.

576,"I liked the movie a lot. I loved what it attempted to accomplish. But, the execution felt a bit clumsy.

They screwed up by making Ken the more active protagonist of the story. Ken has a very clear ""want"" whereas Barbie never even really even accepts her call to action. Ken wants something easy to understand and more easily relateable. It's incredibly dangerous to give a completely powerless character in society the drive to increase their status. Throw in a few music and dance numbers and the audience is going to get on board.

Barbie is set up as an antagonist, (wants to maintain the status quo) or at the very least her wants are much less clear than Ken's. She wants to rid herself of the societal anxiety that comes with simply existing as a woman. While that makes a good point, it is held onto until near the end of the movie and is used more as a reveal than her driving force.",2023-07-23 07:10:19,24,movies,JimLarimore,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

581,"I saw this the other day and‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. I liked a lot of it, but it felt like every statement the movie tried to make was undermined by something else and it just made it feel confused and like the production pulled it in too many directions

Maybe the most confusing part is what Greta Gerwig‚Äôs actual take on Barbie is. The movie continuously flips from painting her as a legitimate feminist icon and using Will Ferrell‚Äôs character (undoubtedly the worst part of the movie) to say that she‚Äôs just the corporate idea of feminism designed by men. It feels like it tries too hard to appeal to both the people that have genuine affection for Barbie and those that say she took feminism in the wrong direction. Which is an interesting balance, but the movie never felt like it drew a final conclusion about it. 

I‚Äôm also really bothered by the final line in the movie. Why cast a trans actress to play a Barbie in Barbieland if you‚Äôre going to end the movie with a weird throwaway line about how ‚Äúreal‚Äù women visit the gynecologist? I highly doubt that Gerwig meant anything transphobic by the ending, but it really stuck out in a movie where they bring positive attention multiple times to the fact that the Barbieland residents have no genitalia. 

Overall, I think the movie tried to do a bit too much and its tone and ambitions don‚Äôt really match up in any satisfying way. I‚Äôd probably give it a 3/5 overall and I was really hoping to love it given my adoration for Greta‚Äôs previous work.

590,"Just finally watched it. I get that the whole idea of Barbie is catered towards girls, female empowerment, etc. And that's fine. But I feel like the underlying message of the move is so representative of what I dislike about the \[extreme\] feminist movement.

At the start of the movie, women are in total control of Barbie land (obviously). When the Kens take over, it is seen as bad and we need to get back to the original arrangement where Barbies rule everything. Obviously, patriarchy is a bad thing but the idea that matriarchy is the solution is just the exact same problem, but reversed. This is what led the Kens to rebel when Ryan Gosling comes back after having tasted male empowerment in the real world. He wants that because he has zero power in Barbie land. When the Barbies take back control, a few of the Kens even ask for a seat in the supreme court or whatever (i.e., asking for equality), and the President just flat out denies them (they ultimately settle for lower court positions I think).

The takeaway/lessons learned from the Ken perspective is that Ken is his own individual, and he need not be defined by the ""And Ken"" stereotype in which his sole purpose in life is to be merely an afterthought/sidekick to Barbie. And that's a great message, but it gets overshadowed by the other message which is that a righteous and just society is one where women are in control. That's delusional. There should be gender equality, but that concept never even comes up (unless I missed it at the end).

However, I will respect this movie for taking a lot of risks, like making a kids franchise PG-13, depicting sexual harassment, and directly calling out the CEO's of the brand it was about.

Not to oversimplify, but I felt that Barbieland is introduced as a world with flipped gender roles (barbies control everything and ken do nothing but try to get barbies attention), then they declare that patriarchy is bad, and then it ends with Barbies undermining the Kens to reestablish their matriarchy. The only difference is that now Ken has intrinsic self worth (though no real role, home, or representation in society) and Stereotypical Barbie completes her maturity by converting from a barbie to a human.

Was that too much to ask for? 
But no. Instead, I got slapped across the face with so very many societal issues that I was just, SO NOT mentally prepped to deal with. I wanted 2 hours of sheer joy but instead got existential crisis.

605,"I appreciate the resolution to the Ken VS Barbie conflict at the end.  I read that most people prefer if the Barbies didn't support the status quo and created a new government that included men equally. 

However, this would give us an all too easy fairy tale ending where everyone lives happily ever when in reality, happily after doesn't exist.  A happy and perfect resolution only serves to make us feel good in the theatre and forget that we still live with the status quo once we exit said theatre.  I find this fairy tale ending highly patronizing.

Women still have to work harder to even stand out for a promotion against a male competitor.  Women get generally paid lower and are usually not in positions of power compared to men.  Hell, women have even less bodily autonomy in the US than men.

If anything, this is a realistic ending.  It's an ending that is designed to encourage discourse and to encourage everyone to challenge the status quo in hopes of a better future for both sexes.

608,"I'm seeing people calling Ken a villain, but was he really that? I saw it more like he was living a life where the world was completely ruled by women and men were secondary , but then he understood that it hadn't to be like that, so he tried to inverse it. The problem was that instead of learning from his experience and making everyone the same, he made it the completely inverse, where men ruled and women were secondary. Then again the Barbies do the EXACT same as Ken did, taking the complete control of Barbieland. I know, Barbies took control teaching the other Barbies, but then instead of trying to use that knowledge to try to talk it and reach a conclusion, they use it to trick the Kens and make only the Barbies vote. Kens didn't even use force to get Barbieland, they just learnt from the Blonde Ken and used that to control Barbieland, but since at that time the Barbies couldn't argue with that they won. So at the end, the Kens will live in the original Barbieland, but now with some more rights. What I think is that neither the Barbies or Kens were villains, they were just trying to fight for the best for themselves, but they never learnt from their situation so they got stuck in the same problem over and over.

They even go as far as make a point about how Hollywood actresses are unrealistically beautiful but they still cast a Hollywood beautiful actress.

The ending is.... Barbie becomes a real girl? What's the message there?

I feel like they pointed out a lot of problems in society and the company but it doesn't really go anywhere with it. Ultimately i guess because it cant.

Gloria's deprogramming speech is a weird one because the Barbies have no real frame of reference for what she's talking about. The struggle she talks about is \*her\* struggle in \*her\* world, but it doesn't mean anything to them. Unless you think about Barbieland, or this version of it, being Gloria's 'creation'.

&#x200B;

I think my favourite scene is where Barbie first gets to the real world and sits on the bench. Robbie does a great job of showing Barbie experiencing all this emotion for the first time from seeing the couple laughing to seeing someone just looking sad and telling that old lady that she's beautiful. Despite it being called Barbie it doesn't really give her that much to work with (You can argue Gosling has the clearer arc) but the few grace notes she gets she kills it.",2023-09-21 18:25:50,23,movies,runwithjames,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

And the deep conversations we had with the other girls about femininity, our struggles, yes, and the unfairness, but also the things we love and enjoy about being ""ordinary Barbies""!

642,"P good. Though It felt like they just genuinely didn't know how to end it and kind of just made the fact that they didn't know how to end it be a gag. Pretty messy at the end. Didn't love all the long speeches where the movie just beats you over the head with its message over and over again.

644,"I gotta say I was disappointed. Here is why:

1. Way too direct. They directly state the feminism stuff instead of showing it. Come on guys use some subtlety. Mattel wanted it to be blatantly stated I imagine for marketing appearance.

2. I venture to say that the barbies on the shelves are far less diverse than the cast. Most Barbies are white. I think mattel wanted their product to seem like they value diversity more than they do. 

3. The casting of a plus size actress bothered me when in fact, barbie does not have a doll that mirrors her body size. I think it should, but Mattel does not make that. They have 'curvy barbie' which, if translated to the real world, probably would have a bmi well within the healthy range, but is still like ideal placements for body mass. Like it's all in the hips, butt, boobs. She's got no belly and no love handles. Again, I think mattel wanted to make it seem like their product reflects plus size body types when they actually never made a doll for that. 

4. When I played with Barbies I remember we would make them fuck each other and harm each other. I guess they kinda alluded to that with weird barbie. But I would've liked to see that more. I think most little girls are not just having them participate in their careers and whatnot. Little girls are acting out their messed up inner thoughts with those toys for sexual exploration and violent urges. 

5. The Corporate execs were just kinda there. Again, Mattel didn't want it to go too far with the corporate dark side. 

6. The whole issue with dolls and little girls playing with dolls and how that relates to the patriarchy is that the little girls are not stimulating those complex parts of their brains. So even if you play with engineer barbie, you're still just playing dolls. You're not actively thinking through spatial patterns or building things with your hands that will later help you advance in science and math fields. This was not addressed. Mattel, give the kids like a puzzle to solve or something to build with their hands while they play with barbie. And then pay me for the idea.",2023-07-24 23:04:23,22,movies,Patient-Evening-4282,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
645,"Just saw it today. Loved it. I agree the Will Ferrel parts were weird and unnecessary. 
I can also understand why conservative trolls feel so threatened by it, it's not for the weak minded.
It's a bright, fun, silly little movie for anyone who had a Barbie and treated it like gold, or played with it ""too hard"". Its also a good message, for both boys and girls, to not let your identity get lost in another person. Be Barbie and be Ken.",2023-08-17 01:31:51,22,movies,Thedonitho,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
646,"Finally watched it last night‚Ä¶ liked it overall but I felt the second half kind of fell off somewhat. The first half wasn‚Äôt exactly subtle by any means but the social / gender commentary was clever and fun, and I enjoyed the performances. 

In the second half I felt like they started to try to really beat audiences over their head with the messaging and all the relative subtlety was thrown out the window. To be clear I‚Äôm not an incel who hates the message. I just don‚Äôt necessarily love films where the messaging is written explicitly into expository dialogue to the point where it‚Äôs being spoon fed to us like we‚Äôre idiots. The whole monologue that America Ferrara had towards the end about women‚Äôs obstacles in a patriarchal society just felt sooo heavy-handed‚Ä¶ it grounded the film to a total halt and took me out of the narrative. I felt like all the goodwill the first half of the movie had generated start to sour somewhat as a result of these second-half choices, as it just began to feel like, Wow, this film doesn‚Äôt trust us enough to understand what they were getting at early in the film, and now they‚Äôre literally just spelling it out and clobbering us with it. 

Having said that I still enjoyed it overall. Margot Robbie was perfect in the role, and her acting has gotten so strong in the past decade since Wolf of Wall Street. I liked her in that film too but I think she‚Äôs spoken in interviews of hiring dialect coaches etc and you can really trace her refining her craft with some of her recent projects and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if she gets an Oscar nom here. There were some emotional moments where I found myself quite moved (such as the scene on the park bench with the older lady) and I think it‚Äôs a testament to her skills as an actress to be able to make us care about a Barbie doll, as the character could have been written so differently and been much more of a one-trick ‚Äúfish out of water‚Äù pony. Having said that I wouldn‚Äôt have minded more of the film taking place in the real world and seeing some more of their antics in modern society. 

Ryan Gosling was hilarious and stole the show in a comedic sense, but I liked that Margot had the dramatic moments to counter the silliness. But that scene at the school where he‚Äôs talking to the mom for example was cracking me up. And when he shows off all his wrist watches later. üòÇ

I‚Äôm sure there will be sequels and spin offs and a Mattel-verse but I‚Äôd probably rather they just leave it alone as a good single shot story. Everything wrapped up nicely, and continuing it and recapturing the zeitgeist magic will probably be tough.",2023-12-17 16:02:27,22,movies,PeterLoew88,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

648,"I don't know what, but I kinda hoped they would do more with Midge. Especially since she got her own promotional poster, it seems odd that all she said the entire movie was ""Hi Barbie"". And why wasn't she living in the Weird Barbie house with all the other discontinued dolls? Is it just because she's not a Barbie herself?

Otherwise, absolutely loved this movie. Lived up to the hype for me. The whole theatre was in fits at ""Note to the filmmakers: Margot Robbie is the wrong person to cast to make this point.""",2023-07-21 20:23:21,22,movies,screamingpeaches,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
649,"I just saw it with the wife and just didn‚Äôt ‚Äòget it‚Äô the messages felt a bit muddled and confused in what it was trying to say:

- Why was the real world so slapstick? (Where America and her Daughter were the only normal people really)
- The bloke who was clearly happy they were in a patriarchy and hiding it better‚Ä¶weird inclusion

- I don‚Äôt think the movie addressed the patriarchy well, it was a flat thing of ‚Äòmen have done this to women‚Äô rather than ‚Äòcenturies of history impact men and women‚Äôs behaviour‚Äô (toxic masculinity being reinforced onto men by both men and women)

-They made mentions of stuff which would‚Äôve been interesting to include e.g. how women cause problems for other women

-was this meant to be a movie about mothers and daughters?

-I don‚Äôt get why Barbie decided to be human at the end? (We had that one scene where she watched some men laugh and chatted to the old woman‚Äî-but didn‚Äôt seem to have any major changes other than that)

- America Ferrara‚Äôs monologue about women again made it sound like a thing that was purposefully done to them by men‚Ä¶when many of the things she talks about effect both sexes one ways (and then women have some issues men don‚Äôt, men have other issues women don‚Äôt‚Ä¶or experience the same issues in different ways-like showing emotions)



I‚Äôm guessing there was more story about mother and daughter in there originally and it got cut to focus more on Barbie? (And the dad just chucked in there)

It was very funny in places and I get some of the messages it was going for (as a psychologist who knows stuff about sociology too) but it was too shallow in doing them.



I think Little Women by Gertwig and ‚Äòeverything everywhere all at once‚Äô covered some of the stuff about society and mother/daughter relationships better‚Ä¶maybe even Legally Blonde does ‚ÄòBarbie feminism‚Äô a bit better",2023-07-27 21:56:38,22,movies,hadawayandshite,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
650,"I may have misinterpreted this, but even though this movie could be considered feminist, I actually appreciate the resolution being much more realistic.

The barbies could have restructured into a society with equal representation but they did not.  This retains the true spirit of human nature, once in power, people will often do everything they can to retain it, woman or man.

651,"Am I the only person who thinks that the Barbie movie's message might have gone in the wrong direction?

I went to see the movie with a couple of my friends and firstly, holy shit it was so colourful. Just based on the style and humour I would say that it was a good movie. But then there is the message.

Just ignoring the main plot for a second.

The entire movie was just barbie not treating ken right, ken discovering that other men can treat him better than barbie, leaving barbie, and then establishing ken land (With the completely forced plot of brainwashing). Then the barbies instead of talking about it comes up with the idea to first give the Kens the best of their lives by giving them attention, then immediately making them jealous by hanging out with the other kens to make the Kens fight. The kens obviously make up and don't fight for too long, and then afterwords when the main ken explains to barbie that she didnt treat him right and all he wanted was some form of attention and validation she just said go figure it out urself lol.

And at the end the barbies all take control over barbie land again and remove the kens' power. Then when the kens go to the barbies (after learning their lesson) and ask if they can get some spots in the supreme Court and police and shit, the Barbies just say no.

They actually just made full circle.",2023-07-30 20:31:26,22,movies,Ingusdingle,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

657,"Transgressive masterpiece. Though IMO fell just short of being called ""masterpiece"". Walked an extremely fine line between genuine sentimentality and cringe, and every time they veered into the ""cringe"" they looped it around and integrated it perfectly into the movie. I hope it makes the biggest losers on the planet moan like the children they are. Hilarious, philisophical, avante-garde, weird, emotional. Such a fantastic flick. Not in a rush to see it again but there are so many moments of brilliance. 

The opening 20 minutes or so (until barbie starts her real world adventure) is truly inspired. I love the bumbling mattel execs. Feels like a response to the Lego Movie in many ways (obviously). Just a grand grand time at the movies. Heartbreak feels good in a place lile this.

Shoutout to Margot Robbie who killed it as Barbie and acted her fucking ass off, but Ryan Gosling stole the show. Ken was by far the best part of the movie.",2023-07-21 16:52:10,22,movies,vaseinahouse,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

659,"Gf and I just got home and we loved it. Her experience with it was very personal and was crying during the Billie ellish ending sequence.

I loved the meta feminist aspect to the film but one thing I also appreciate is the film did go out of it's way to make sure there were no real villians, especially the Ken's. All Ken wanted was to be seen and respected as an equal (like women do in the real world) and not be treated as just a boyfriend or afterthought. He had emotions he was trying to repress and grew frustrated at his situation, then when he saw how men acted in our world he only saw how they were treated with respect and decided ""this how ill be seen and make everyone respect me"" and it led to a completely misogynistic ""ken"" world where really they just wanted to feel in control imof their lives. Because Ken and the other Kens weren't ever treated as equals they fought back. Obviously they were in the wrong, but Ken admits he knew that, he just didn't know what else to do and felt no one wanted to listen to him.

Eventually Ken learns the same lesson Barbie does in that we can be beyond our expectations and be whoever we want and to not be afraid of our emotions, and Barbie helps him cone to this conclusion while also apologizing for treating him poorly. 

Ken wasn't evil, he was misunderstood and just wanted to feel seen, just like Barbie did, but because we live in a society where men are told to be ""strong and silent, repress your feelings and emotions"" we have the equation for toxic masculinity. 

This can be applied to Andrew Tate followers, red-pillers, Trumper, etc. It's a clear demonstration of how toxic masculinity is even created and how these monsters of people take advantage of lost and emotionally confused men. 

You could write an entire thesis paper on the themes this film covers.",2023-08-02 05:33:59,22,movies,rdp3186,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
660,"First half was solid but second half really fell off.  The set design and direction were steller and the performances were honestly perfect for the characters. However, the writing is where this movie really falls behind. For one most of the humor in the movie relied on meta jokes, which consisted of some social commentary said in a joking cadence, which is supposed to be tongue and cheek but ends up feeling lazy. The many  monologues in the movie felt preachy and out of place which is disappointing considering greta gerwig's past scripts. Much of the dialogue fell prone to issues were characters would start giving mini lectures on the themes of the movie, feeling like more like a school play  than a multimillion dollar movie made by oscar nominated writers. The themes of feminism expressed in the movie also felt superficial and infantile with many moments sharing conflicting messages that run contrary to classic feminist thought. The movie was also around 15 minutes too long with the end dragging for quite a while. Overall I felt this  movie had a lot of potential with great background elements but underperformed with the story.

661,"It was a movie with great visuals and genuine laughs, but I found the feminist message really muddled. Some of it rang true to me, and some of it really didn't. 

It paints gender politics as a zero-sum game; either men are winning or women are. The happy ending is the Kens continuing to be oppressed, just slightly less? I mean, I know some of it might be a bit tongue-in-cheek, but it didn't quite read right to me. 

When the Barbies are trying to take back their homes, they emotionally manipulate the Kens against each other, suggesting that women only have power through men, and not in their own right. Really not my idea of an empowering message.

663,"I think there‚Äôs layered themes to this movie that need unpacking almost like all the different worlds Barbie has to pass through before entering into the real world. Though all the themes are just conveying a singular message: It is only when we stop defining ourselves by others (ill intent or well intent) that we can allow ourselves to live. These definitions become a box that suffocates us. What is explored in this movie are all the ‚Äúothers‚Äù that exist in a modern societies. 

The most powerful one, the last one addressed in the movie (the firsts being matriarchy, feminism, and patriarchy) is how we are being defined by our parents (the dad represented by the CEO and the mom represented by Ruth). While the dad, somewhat simplistic but well intended, by just wanting their daughter to fall in love as their ending‚Ä¶it is until we are released by that can Barbie live. That was the Dads idea and definition of Barbie. The mom, represented by Ruth is to allow Barbie be who she is, something more than an idea, and it is only when she wants to outgrow that that she becomes human.


Barbie is defined by Mattel and the stories it provided to sell toys. Though well intended, we realize that it is a box that Barbie can no longer fit into.",2023-08-19 05:19:36,22,movies,PepperMintGumboDrop,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

I mean, America Ferrara and the daughter just show up and we're supposed to care about them. 

Ryan Gosling is the MVP but I do think Margot Robbie is just as good and I don't think they could have found a better choice for Barbie. She looks like Barbie. 

I don't get why Kate McKinnon and Michael Cera got so much praise. McKinnon is pretty much playing the tired SNL persona and Cera's awkward Allan is a one joke character.

Yes, the Kens have this moment when they realize they can be whatever they wanna be and their existence should not be dictated by their relationship to those in power. It's a cheesy sequence when they come to believe anything is possible... only for things to go back to exactly the way they were when it comes down to it.

And I'll admit, sometimes (not always), as a man, I feel like it's an attack on me, and I feel like it's unfair, because I don't cat call, and if my buddy catcalled, he wouldn't be my buddy for long. Sometimes these speeches feel like they're unfairly putting something on my shoulders. This one didn't feel like that at all, I don't know why.

Of course I didn't understand or really feel a lot of what she was talking about in this speech. I'm not a woman, I don't know what it's like to be a woman in our world. But it was like, yeah, I don't really *get* it, but that must suck, I'm sorry you're going through that.

675,"Honest thoughts, I think I made a mistake watching this a day after Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer is in a higher tier artistically and was much impactful and made it more difficult to take in Barbie.

I'd give Barbie a 6.5.

Cons:
* I found it hard to parse the point or message of the movie. Felt like there was a couple conflicting lines that were competing for each other.
* Margot Robbie was a bit flat in the movie. Even when she was supposed to be sentimental and feeling it didn't  necessarily hit, although maybe this was by design. 
* Not sure what several parts of the outside world added to the movie. What did Will Ferrel's character actually contribute to the film? He was hardly a villain. Or Ferrera's daughter beyond a half scene?
* Brief cameos didn't really add to the movie. And the movie was overmarketed, which I think is skewing reviews.

Pros:
* Set and costumes 10/10, great take on the Barbie world
* Music and sound 10/10. The musical scenes were great, and I think Greta can tackle a full on musical. 
* Ensemble cast generally did great. Standouts are Weird Barbie, the 2 main Kens and Allen
* Hysterical moments in between, especially in the Kendom part. 

I'd recommend watching Barbie before Oppenheimer and with at least a couple days before watching it. I'd recommend this as part of a cultural event, but I don't think it'll have much replay value",2023-07-23 17:35:24,21,movies,greezyo,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
676,"I enjoyed the subtle-not-so-subtle aspect of the radicalised Kens reducing their Barbies to non-committal committed relationships and the Barbies expected to just go along with it. Something I see my fellow women go through a LOT, making do with absolute scraps from shitty men. When it was Barbieland, the Barbies just don't look at Kens in a romantic sense, but when it's Kendom, they are cornered into a ""bare minimum"" relationship while being relegated to second place accessory in all areas of life. Damn, Greta! 

I also felt that the glaring gap in men's modern societal identity was highlighted when the only way Ken can really find himself is to just be himself. I don't know if this is entirely the answer for every guy but I think it's a worth considering. You are you, you don't have to completely leave yourself behind to fit society's toxic idea of masculinity to be a ""real man"". Something about how Barbie leaves Barbieland behind and gains autonomy and Ken stays because he found himself outside of the romantic/societal expectations of men.

I really loved the moment where Barbie was shown everything being a girl and a woman is then just says ""Yes"". 

I could honestly go for this winning Best Picture or at least getting nominated. It's an extremely well made film.",2023-07-23 05:39:35,21,movies,,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
677,"This film has been in the works since 2009 and given its time in the works and the brilliant marketing of this movie's release I couldn't believe how unfinished and underdeveloped the screenplay felt. It felt more like a film centred on a draft rather than a final version. There were some scenes and jokes that were brilliant however the screenwriters insisted on taking on too many complex themes at once, leaving them unsatisfactority explored and left the plot feeling jumbled in trying to keep up with them at times.

The exploration and conclusion of the existentialism theme felt criminally base-level given how hyped this element of the story was. I could perhaps have been more satisifed with the conclusion of this theme had the philosophical assertions been explored to a greater degree, but if anything I felt sad for Barbie that she felt forced to leave behind an eternity of joyous contentment for an ephemeral life emburdened with struggle. It's a complicated subject to tackle & I feel screenwriters set themselves up for a near impossible task taking on existentialism as one of the main themes while also heavily leaning into other complex themes like gender struggle and consumerism, all while remaining playful and lighthearted. This theme didn‚Äôt even necessarily need a conclusion, acknowledgement throughout the screenplay of it‚Äôs impact on humans would have worked better for me than the attempt to consolidate the harsh realities of human existence. The film just isn‚Äôt ‚Äòdeep‚Äô enough to tackle that and that‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs Barbie, I don‚Äôt expect to leave with any philosophical awakening. Simply relating and feeling affirmed in my human emotion would have been enough.

Probably the most fleshed-out theme in the whole story was gender struggle. Barbie felt like the perfect opportunity to explore this theme in a campy and fun and clever way and they achieved this excellently throughout the plot, however the writers were evidently not confident in the audience's critical thinking capabilities when it comes to extracting and discussing this messaging from the screenplay without any spoon-fed lecturing. I'm a feminist and resonate with much of the struggles portrayed but I couldn't help but feel the movie took itself a bit too seriously in delivery at times when it would have been far more effective to simply playfully explore this power-struggle. I can't help but feel they ruined it by spoonfeeding what was already clearly substantiated by the screenplay alone. 

Gloria and Sasha's relationship were grossly underdeveloped. Sasha was completely unlikeable and seemed to treat her mother and everyone around her like garbage for no explicable reason. Had we had some insight on her own struggle with mental health, teenage angst and struggle navigating the appropriate level of assertiveness for each social situation, this could have helped, however her backstory is glossed over entirely. Gloria was more likeable and we get more insight into her struggles than Sasha's, however she also fell a bit flat for me. She struggles with complex feelings that the film simply did not have the time to explore and for me the overall lack of emotional intimacy with her as a character made it difficult to feel invested in her arc.

Mattel and their place in the story also felt like a glaring afterthought for screenwriters. Aside from acting as a gateway for Gloria and Barbie's eventual 'reunion' and maybe a few comedic jabs at patriarchy and capitalism they served very little to the plot and wasted critical time.

Even Barbieland, controversially it seems, felt quite underdeveloped as a concept. The map was tiny and yet it is implied that every Barbieland barbie has a real-world owner. Are the majority of owned Barbies simply not represented in Barbieland? Perhaps I‚Äôm being a bit pedantic here‚Ä¶I did really enjoy the the set design and costumes however, also found the casting was brilliant. I enjoyed Ken‚Äôs incel arc and his misguided hyper-fixation on horses and overall the film was enjoyable, but not as iconic and timeless as I had hoped it would be.

678,"I loved this movie and think it may be toward the top of my list as a great film. I didn't know what I expected going in, but I was not expecting that (in the best way possible). It had the worldbuilding creativity of the Lego movie, the set design style of Wes Anderson, the metaness of Community, and the social commentary of South Park. As with the pop culture around the Barbie Doll, it intelligently (not panderingly) utilizes pop culture references including the actors themselves (specific people utilized in specific parts for great commentary, jokes, and presence). It was a fun and relatively straightforward story that managed to make some great social history commentary about the US post WW2 while also exploring the philosophies around what make us human. All while being compasionate and positive towards the groups and types of people it explores.

While it's not really a kids movie, it's an entertaining watch and they can still pick up on some core themes like ""nobodies perfect, we can all get sad and insecure, the grass isn't always greener, and empathy (treat others the way you want to be treated)."" I can definitely see some of this movie going over people's heads to varying degrees and in regards to various themes. So much was going on, I'm unsure if some stuff that I thought was commentary is me reading too much into a scene or line, but that's OK because this moving had so much depth and so many themes to explore.

If I was pressed for complaints, I would say most of the themes were outright stated (but with plenty consistency to back them up) and more than a few of the jokes were ""meh"" (but that only stood out by virtue of how good some other one off and running jokes were).

Overall, I'm ecstatic I experienced this unexpected delight today.",2023-08-19 03:15:31,21,movies,K0M0A,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

I knew it would tackle issues like feminism, beauty standards and the patriarchy, but I didn't realise how overbearing it would be. At times, it almost felt condescending. Don't take me wrong, those issues should have been highlighted, but a part of me wished we spent a little bit more time with Barbie, Ken and their wacky adventures in the real world before moving onto that. I still enjoyed it overall, just wished there had been a bit more balancing between the two tones.

As I predicted going into, Gosling was the best part of the film. They couldn't have casted a better actor for the role.",2023-07-22 20:04:07,21,movies,Turnipator01,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

The plot fell apart for me though. I don't get why Barbie had to become human to fully self-actualize, it looked like all the Barbies were beginning that journey too. And why did they do the Kens so dirty, they just wanted to be acknowledged and respected too ü•≤

684,"I'm surprised so many people find the movie misandrist. In fact, it says a lot about how we are still so far from a fair society. It's only misandrist because it focuses in women and its role as part of a society WITHOUT any real love story behind them. I guess chick flicks are only acceptable if there's some male love interest they fall high heels for (pun intended).
If anything, I think it was more of an attack on how childhood magic is used to manipulate both girls and boys.

Anyway, I found the movie incredibly smart. Every single frame had some kind of thought or concept behind it. It was so layered, honestly one of the most ""brainy"" movies out there. To the point where it could be too much. I did not enjoy the ""packaging"" for those layers though, the action itself and the story was kind of boring.",2023-07-26 21:45:17,21,movies,AlexIdealism,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
685,"I (20M) watched it yesterday quite stoned, I cried like 7 times and it's now my favourite movie

This is the closest to a 10/10 movie I've ever seen. My last favourite movie was Your Name, but I admitted it had some weak points (mostly the ending, which was too long and slow for my taste). Here's ALL I didn't like from Barbie:

-I felt like there were too many horses jokes, although some of them were hilarious.

-I didn't get why when they threw clothing items from Barbie's house they stopped and showed the article. I guess it's a joke but I don't see how it's funny.

-I found it a bit cringey when the little girl is telling her mother that she likes her weird and dark drawings.

That's all the complaints I can think of, aside from that I loved everything: the jokes landed, I understood the characters, the casting and acting was amazing, the design of everything was great, the pacing felt appropriate, the original soundtrack was bop after bop, the choreographies were spectacular... And of course I loved the message and I felt very personally all of Barbie's struggles, even the ones related to the fact that she's a woman even though I'm a cishet man. Maybe weed makes me more empathetic.

Just five minutes in I understood why American conservatives were so upset with the movie, the feminism was evident (and it's a good thing!). I found it so funny when they were presenting Barbieland as the perfect female fantasy, showing mostly childish things, and suddenly there was a Barbie giving a speech about how being more emotional doesn't make you worse for any serious job, and it's even a good thing. This kind of direct messages were everywhere, like when Ken and Barbie are walking in the real world with everyone staring at them, and Ken clearly states that he isn't feeling any kind of danger while Barbie does feel threatened.

Except for the Mattel workers and in a lesser way the mother and daughter, I felt like the real world was completely realistic, the sexism wasn't as exaggerated as some say. It isn't hard to find someone who actually acts like each sexist person they interact with, the fact that they find so many in so little time is unlikely but completely possible.

I don't remember exactly every scene I cried with, but I can tell you that at least every time they played the instrumental of Billie Eilish's song. I cried with the scene of the old woman whom Barbie calls beautiful, with both of the creator's scenes, the mother's first speech, basically everytime Barbie was crying on screen, and weirdly, at the end of Ken's musical number (that key change really got to me). I consider myself a nihilist, so I accept death as part of life and I understand there's nothing else beyond it; but I had never felt like death was such a human thing as when Barbie was giving up her perfect, immortal life. Damn, I'm crying again.

Anyway. I'm scared of watching this movie again sober and realizing it wasn't as good as I think it is. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have cried nearly as much if I hadn't been high, but at least I'll never forget what I felt, it was almost life-changing.",2023-08-24 11:44:54,21,movies,DangerousMarketing91,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

690,"I‚Äôm sure this will get buried but:

As a relatively unextraordinary woman who is neither a president nor a mother, nor a president who is also a mother, I felt seen by Gloria‚Äôs ordinary Barbie idea as well as Barbie‚Äôs struggle to live up to expectations. I loved how Barbie didn‚Äôt feel the need to compare herself to others until she was exposed to the real world. The line about needing to be extraordinary but also not too extraordinary really resonated with me.

On the other hand, as someone who‚Äôs been working on a novel series for years, I related with Ruth Handler as well and absolutely loved the scene with her talking to Barbie. It‚Äôs a little different since they‚Äôre characters in a book, but I feel like if I were to meet my girls IRL somehow, I‚Äôd say something similar to them.

Anyway, great movie.

693,"I loved the first part of the movie but honestly the whole Ken plot line just lost me near the middle and end. Everything felt so spelled out for me, especially the speech.
I feel like it would have made more sense if Barbie took Ferrera to Barbieland as it is with the female president and female Nobel winners and for Ferrera to still feel inadequate or even more inadequate. I feel like it would have pinned down the point they were trying to make about the ‚Äúnormal barbie‚Äù who doesn‚Äôt need to be everything to be amazing. 

Like Barbie thought she would fix Ferreras complex feelings of grief and plainness by showing her all of these really successful images of Barbie like ‚Äúhey women can be everything and anything isn‚Äôt this super uplifting??‚Äù And for Ferrera to respond how I think most women in that state of feeling like they‚Äôre failing at being perfect and plastic, which is even more depressed and inadequate. I thought it was gonna be more metaphorical to how women feel looking at social media with influencers. Instead it became about Ken and fixing all these perfect women in Barbieland and didn‚Äôt really feel impactful on the real world. Although that‚Äôs just my opinion, But I guess as someone who relates more to Ferrera than Barbie, it felt like her storyline ended kind of incomplete.

I mean I think it was impactful for a lot of women, which is important. I did hear some people crying in Ferreras speech. I personally cried during the part where Barbie is sitting on the bench with the old lady. But yeah I just didn‚Äôt love the ending.

703,"I ended up seeing this movie twice.  I think it's fair to say that the messaging is a little confused.

Here's what I mean.  Barbieland is at first portrayed as a total matriarchy.  Barbies rule.  Kens have no personality outside of their relationship to Barbies.

The movie then has Barbie say that women in Barbieland are treated how men are in the real world.

But, the movie also goes out of its way to show us that the real world, while still patriarchal, is more complicated.  Ken can't just go get any job he wants because he's a man.  He has to go to Barbieland to *actually* create that level of patriarchy.

But I find it weird then when the Kens at the end ask for a Supreme Court justice and are told, no, you can't.  Because in the real world, 4/9 justices on the supreme court are women.  It's not a great example to use if you're trying to suggest a parallel between Barbieland and reality.  The presidency would have been a more fitting example.

I definitely get the point as to why the Barbies retain more power in the end.  It's like, the Barbies and Ken have a nice moment where they all realize they should be equal, but then the Barbies still retain most of the power, which is kind of the result of early feminism in the US.

That point makes sense, but I just think it's still hard to pin down exactly what the film is saying about patriarchy in reality.  It seems to simultaneously claim reality is comically patriarchal while also trying to say its a bit more nuanced, and I think that leaves its messages muddled.

I still really like the rest of the movie, I think the production design, performances, jokes, score all work.  But I'm just not sure on its message.",2023-07-25 20:38:23,20,movies,,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

I can see the parellel, and I relate to a lot of the points they made, but nothing was accomplished other than making the comparison. The Barbies dont give the Kens a voice when they just went through a whole movie about how women in the real world dont have a voice. When the Kens ask to be represented in government, they are immediately shot down and told its too big of a responsibility for them. Feminism isnt about ""women and only women are in power or make all the decisions"" its literally just asking to be seen as equal. To be a part of the conversation, and not just as a notetaker/secretary. Everything went back to normal at the end in their respective worlds. If you are someone who cant relate to being left out of the conversation, who cant relate to not being considered, you would miss the point, which is why I think a lot of men didnt like the movie.",2024-01-08 21:04:35,20,movies,jessicermcnfisc0412,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

715,"I was honestly really sad about the Barbie movie. The adverts surrounding it were misleading, and the movie turned into a feminist parody with no solid plotline. It was like it was trying to be political and comedic simultaneously, but the writers got lost. If they had wanted to make a feminist movie, I feel like they could have touched on some other subjects rather than just briefly discussing them in an empowering speech (that wasn't that inspiring). 

For example, Barbie didn't actually help Gloria with her real-life issues; they just magically got resolved through the power of taking down 'Ken-dom'. Gloria was struggling with serious things, such as thoughts of death and anxiety that she hadn't made the right career choices. Barbie didn't comfort her about her body changing (the cellulite, for example); instead, she felt almost selfish because she just wanted to fix herself. These are real issues that everybody faces throughout their lives, not just women but as the film was made primarily for woman empowerment it feels odd that this was not addressed. Because of course Barbie doesn't age she doesn't have these issues but there still could have been scenes where Barbie realises that she doesn't fix every women's issue just by having a ton of careers and clothes.

Because of course, Barbie doesn't age she doesn't have these issues but there still could have been scenes where Barbie realises that she doesn't fix every women's issue just by having a ton of careers and clothes. ed this important issue under the rug. I think it's great to see so much diversity in the dolls and the movies but the diversity can't be acknowledged without realising that it didn't always used to be this way. Multiple movements have pushed for Barbie to become diverse, she wasn't originally created like that which is what makes it such an important moment in time for women everywhere. 

Another thing that wound me up about this movie was they managed to surround the major plot points about a man: Ken. How on earth did they make a movie about a woman surround a man? I completely understand the whole point of Ken's character was supposed to represent how women feel in the real world: overlooked, ignored, powerless etc. But I also feel like the story could have gone a hundred different other ways. I am not bashing on Ken or Ryan Gosling for that matter, he had great character building but why did we need so much of it? Why couldn't the movie have been about Barbie and Ken discovering patriarchy in the real world and both characters discovering the good and bad elements of it? When I say this I refer to Ken more than Barbie. 

One thing the Barbie film did not do enough of was address the discontinued Barbies. Aside from the odd joke, the film completely didn't utilize them enough as key feminist elements. For example, Pregnant Midge and Growing Up Skipper were just lines to make us laugh. How amazing would it have been for Barbie to stand up for them? To say 'there is nothing wrong with having a baby without a husband' or 'puberty is nothing to be ashamed of'. (This comment does ride off the knowledge that you know Pregnant Midge was discontinued for having a wedding ring on) If anything the movie projects ""You can be anything you want - just none of these things or you will get discontinued!

To be honest, there was nothing wrong with the ending but also nothing right with it either. It just kind of left a dry taste in my mouth. For one thing, a 'normal' Barbie? I don't really see the point in that. One of the main things I loved about Barbie was that everything she did was an achievement, whether it was a career, adventure, etc. She changed from a normal pretty girl with a boyfriend to a woman with multitudes of potential. There was nothing ever wrong with being 'normal', but there is reason to celebrate her achievements. As Margot Robbie said in one of her interviews: ""Barbie went to the moon before women even had credit cards."" I am not saying Barbie was the sole influence behind feminism but god just seeing a doll doing something you couldn't must have made women think, ""Hey! I want that too!"". 

The move to make Barbie human wasn't really something I was personally interested in. I don't understand the flashes of people she sees at the end or why she wanted to become human. I suppose it was to feel 'alive'? If someone could explain this to me that would be great. 

I just feel like the movie didn't hit home with me because it was moving between two goal posts, trying to feminist and trying to be funny. There were obviously moments were is succeeded like when Ken was playing guitar on the beach and he was like ""I am going to play for four and half minutes and stare awkwardly into your eyes"" - I feel like every woman has been in that position or something similar. However aside from those few moments of reliability, the movie just had too many balls in the air and couldn't catch them. 

Feel free to disagree with me, my opinion isn't only the correct one and maybe my standards were too high but I just thought it was going to be super funny or super feminist which would have been fine either way. I think maybe I need to watch it again to get more of a grounded opinion of it but right now I am not it's biggest fan.",2023-07-25 00:42:49,20,movies,PsychologyPig,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

One part I found a bit too much was of the real life woman who manages to un-brainwash the Barbies.

721,"Just saw this with a crowd likely much different than most posting here, a non-US crowd where people in general don't really audibly react to things very much. Also no one wearing pink in sight. Not a bad movie, but without an involved crowd it hit a bit flat overall. I honestly think the Barbenheimer of it all and the cinema viewing experience with fervent crowds is greatly benefiting the movie. Without that, I think it'd be regarded as better than you'd ever expect from a Barbie/toy movie to be, and overall a decent comedy with a plot that's otherwise a bit of mess, but nothing you must rush to the theaters for. 

**Spoilers here forward:**

I also just find the end result of the Kens in Barbieland a little odd given the overall themes and messages of the movie. Maybe I was expecting something too much and just reading into things, but it felt like there were numerous setups for some sort of ""oh, the real world isn't the equality heaven we thought, which has made me think about our own Barbieland and realize that the Kens are a bit of second class citizens, generally just our accessories and we should be supporting them to be more"" type of turn. Like there's the ""oh, I don't know where Ken's live"" line which I thought would be a setup for something, and while it likely is meant to tie into Ken's line of ""I hoped this would be *our* house"" thing later, it kind of was just a throw away line. When the Barbies are gung ho to make Barbieland basically exactly how it was to start with I was waiting for Barbie to have the ""excuse me, actually i think..."" moment. In the end, there's a little bit of it with the whole helping Ken realize that Kens can have an identity exclusive of their Barbies and should be able to be fulfilled without a Barbie, but something just felt a bit missing imo. Like basically the underclass rises up after finding out about an alternative possibility, then is squashed back down to where they were in society with a slight caveat of ""we'll let you start being involved in some minor positions.""

In the end the movie is just ultimately about Barbie coming to realizations about life and helping her Ken realize a life without her and likely delving into such a plot was outside of what Gerwig wanted to focus on...but I feel that plot easily could have been fit in if the Mattel Board of Executives just weren't in the movie, as other than getting Will Ferrel's name for marketing idk what they really added. You even have the teenager to be like ""uh, I'm all for women in power but this society is kinda messed up"". Idk, maybe that'd be too stereotypical of a plot but I think it would have led to more of an actual ending/leaving point for Barbie rather than everything going more or less back to normal and then her just leaving because the world she fought to restore she doesn't really enjoy anymore...",2023-08-17 13:40:20,20,movies,SexHarassmentPanda,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

I'm just mad people are so angry about this aspect of the film that they dismiss other good aspects this movie has to brings.

Perhaps just another sign of the times. Watching Barbie as a Catholic Latino who grew up on 80s action films and still enjoys Herculean muscular action, i never once thought this film is some ultra-feministic anti-men social commentary on the horrors of Western patriarchal society or whatever these people are saying.

730,"It was a decent movie. The jokes were hard-hitting and the movie itself was 'pleasing to the eyes' but the message was a bit confusing. I understand that the overarching message was something like 'be who you want to be' but you cannot ignore the obvious - yes, it's mean to men. 

I think one can make an argument that the treatment of kens is equivalent to women in real world but then, why didn't it talk about matriarchy in the same light as patriarchy? In the real world, there is a sense of what equal rights and opportunities are about. In Barbieland, kens lived in ignorance of their own rights. Throughout the movie, kens were the butt of the joke and portrayed as just dumb.

Overall, it was a movie I enjoyed but the flaws are obvious. 6/10.",2023-07-23 11:59:53,20,movies,Damkin0032,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

I also appreciated that Mattell more or less poked fun at itself as the bad guys, and acknowledges that both product and company are not without some level of fault. Nice touch that they included a bit of history with Ruth Handler, not even shying away from her mastectomy and legal issues.

All in all, definitely worth a rewatch.",2023-07-23 21:30:10,20,movies,FinishingDutch,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

736,"10/10. This movie was everything i wanted it to be and more. A lot of posters are complaining about its lack of subtleness. While there certain themes thrown in the viewer's face, there was also layers of feminist theory and intersectionality baked into every layer of this film. 

Ultimately, I think think Barbieland is supposed to represent the women (and more specifically white feminists) who believe the feminist movement has already won- think the ‚Äúgirl boss‚Äù type. So many women argue now that the feminist movement is done, equality has been achieved- ignoring the barriers still in place for many women, especially those with intersecting identities. 

That‚Äôs why it takes America Ferrera‚Äòs character and her daughter, women with intersecting identities, to teach Barbie that her brand of feminism has not helped or solved all the problems for every women. By the end of the movie, Barbie‚Äôs decision to leave Barbieland and go to the real world represents how she‚Äôs accepted this reality and no longer wants to live behind the veil of ignorance. 

It also represents how this ‚Äúgirl power‚Äù feminism is commercialized and sold to women. Like how Mattel and its executive board of men still control Barbieland behind the scenes, girl boss feminism ignores that men still hold much of power in the world. And tagging #girlboss on IG photos doesn‚Äòt change this. 

This movie is also clearly criticizing white beauty standards. This is illustrated by America Ferrera‚Äôs character, a Latino women, sketching a blonde white women and later telling Barbie ‚ÄùI can‚Äôt be you.‚Äù This is commentary on the impact of media that has traditionally presented white beauty standards as ideal has on non-white women from an early age. It also shows the impact of unattainable beauty standards on even women like Barbie- or real life women like Marilyn Monroe- who do fit these ideal standards.

America Ferrera‚Äòs speech at the end that cures the Barbies is literally the concept of double consciousness first theorized by W.E.B. DuBois, a notable early civil rights thinker and activist. There‚Äôs so much more that I could dive into, but whoever wrote this script is clearly well-versed in feminist film theory. I could write a master‚Äôs thesis about all the theory presented in this film.   


Lastly, I find it laughable that people think the end of the movie invalidates the message of the film. Barbieland reverses gender roles. So this represents how in the real world, even when feminists ‚Äúwon‚Äú battles like securing the right to vote, it still took decades for meaningful change to be implemented. Expecting that change to be immediate when gender roles are reversed is irony at its finest. They‚Äôre missing the point that both the patriarchy and feminism are institutions and ideas people invented to deal with living in a shitty world. There isn‚Äôt a magical way to fix it- we saw how everyone was negatively impacted in some fashion by both the gender roles and systems in the real world and Barbieland. However, by acknowledging this dynamic and emphasizing with each other, we can begin to fix it.

I think this movie did a fantastic job in bringing to light criticisms of both feminism and the patriarchy. It uses satire in a very similar way to the Scum Manifesto, which is going to going over a lot of people‚Äôs heads. Regardless, I loved every minute of it and am glad this movie is bringing these conversations into  the spotlight.",2023-07-25 22:28:46,20,movies,Dismal-Channel-9292,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

738,"Just get out from the theater. I was so excited by this movie, I wear pink from toes to makeup. 

Never been that disappointed by a movie. 

The directing is mid. There is absolutely nothing astonishing. Production design was great for Barbieland tho and it‚Äôs the only good thing. 

There was a serious problem of rythm, the jokes felt flat because of it, the writing is Prometheus level of bad. 

Greta Gerwig being the first female director to hit the billion at the box-office is painful.

I never get the hype around her (her Little Women was atrocious) but even more now.

The film take itself wayyyyy too seriously for something that was supposed to be satirical and it‚Äôs the main problem. 

The mother daughter were useless. The character development basically inexistant or just ¬´¬†too on the nose¬†¬ª 

I love a good movie who call out the patriarchy, this one isn‚Äôt. Its painful it‚Äôs gonna be raise as a cult movie about feminism. And I‚Äôm really pissed to have the same feelings as incels, but feminism is way more than just misandrist boring message. It‚Äôs not offensive for men at all, it‚Äôs offensive for women. And the plot should be lead by the actions WITH a feminist message, not a plot leading by a message without being consistent. Storytelling don‚Äôt work that way. 

Moreover, where was the FUN ?! 

It‚Äôs painful that a light hearted comedy like Legally blonde which came out 20 years ago is a better feminist movie with a better writing, rythm, than a movie made by Oscars nominees (and I usually love what‚Äôs Noah Baumbach is doing) 

Good point : Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were really good. 

The last time I was this pissed when I left the theater was when I had to endure a Luc Besson movie for a date, (but at least you know that you are going to see shit) Yea that was fucking Luc Besson level of bad, sorry not sorry.",2023-08-13 16:14:50,20,movies,EJFWoodhouse,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

740,"Saw it last night and didn‚Äôt like the movie at all for various reasons. First the obvious, I felt it leant into misandry (perhaps more so than the director is aware she was doing) with its portrayal of all men as morons or morons who are doing something wrong. Now I know this being reddit some people will be angered by that, but I just watched Thelma and Louise which is about the most female empowerment movie there is, and men are also on the receiving end of a lot of negative portrayal in that - but I never got the feeling that that movie was anti man. In that random men who own diners or whatever aren‚Äôt just portrayed as stupid and to be mocked, there‚Äôs the Harvey Keitel character who isn‚Äôt just some dumb mean man etc 

In Barbie every Ken and real world man is a moron or a moron in the wrong. Even Gloria‚Äôs husband is randomly written as a goof who seems lame to his wife and daughter, despite him having nothing to do with the themes of sexism or men holding women down.

Second imo the writing is bad. Plot lines are started as though they‚Äôre important but never really fleshed out. Academic style language is used by characters it doesn‚Äôt fit as characters become interchangeable voice pieces for the themes and messages of the movie. 
Themes conflict with one another so messaging is lost - for example Ken is supposed to be both the patriarchy and the oppressed (like real world women when he‚Äôs in Barbie land) so it‚Äôs like is this guy meant to be bad for standing up to his oppressors? And the symbolism of him and the Kens representing real world women is watered down because they‚Äôre shown as goofballs who don‚Äôt really even want to be in charge.

Basically there are way too many themes being presented in a small space. I feel the movie would have been much stronger had they stuck to Barbies original existential/mid life crisis story line with a side of women empowerment and made the other themes short jokes.

Third the humour was off for me. There were some funnish parts and the weird Barbie was a nest idea, but overall I didn‚Äôt laugh much at all, actually in long stretches the movie wasn‚Äôt fun in the least imo. In my theatre most of the jokes didn‚Äôt seem to land but I‚Äôve also heard the opposite so obviously some people thought it was funny. There were a lot of obscure references that were slightly family guyish that didn‚Äôt work for me. Also that last Vagina joke? Lol seriously that‚Äôs the ending?

All in all the movie wasn‚Äôt that long but it sure felt long to me. Driving back from the palace I was worried my woman was going to say she loved it and want to talk about it but she thought it was kinda boring and just ok, so that was a relief. I can imagine this movie starting a lot of arguments between couples where the chick has gotten their man to go to the movie without him knowing much about it and thinking it will just be a fun romp like the ol Flinstones live action or something.",2023-08-01 06:26:56,20,movies,LongDongSamspon,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
741,"I was pretty disappointed with the movie after all of this hype. I felt like it was a lot of ALMOST‚Ä¶ almost funny, almost female empowering, almost individually empowering, almost smart. 

The Barbie sets and the costumes were what took this movie to the next level IMO. They were masterful. The story itself was boring. Also America Ferrera‚Äôs monologue about the plight of women, while accurate, took me completely out of the moment of satire, comedy, and inference. I really think AF, her daughter, and the entire Mattel staff storyline should have been left out.

It feels strange to say considering the message of the movie, but I thought anytime the Kens were on screen the movie was significantly better. I thought the movie was 10-15 minutes too long because it felt like it really tried to add on the emotional elements with Ruth at the end, but they just didn't sit with me. Not sure why Barbie needed to become human unless it's to set up a sequal. 

Gosling was incredible, Robbie was divine, Kate Mackinnon was pretty funny as well. The theme is definitely on the nose and sometimes felt a little too much so, but again that would depend on the viewer.

I was hoping for a more profound dialogue or character arcs, but it was all very repetitive and childish (which was probably what they were going for?).

751,"Part of this is probably due to the fact that it was caught in development hell since 2009, but I think a lot of people's issues with this film can be explained by the fact this is basically two movies smashed together into one. 

The first movie is about Margot's character having an existential crisis, visiting the real world and learning it's not like she imagined, and helping Sasha and her mother reconnect while also finding out who she is, ending with her wanting to become human herself. 

The second movie is about the inequality between Barbies/Kens, how it's basically the inverse of women and men in real life, and one Ken learning about how men are treated in real life and overthrowing Barbie Land with those ideals, forcing the Barbies and Kens to confront the issues with their society and giving a satirical reflection of sexism IRL. 

Both deal with major philosophical themes but I think the movie struggles a bit to fully flesh out and neatly tie up the two storylines within the constraints of a 2 hour runtime. Because of that we get a lot of half baked plotlines (the Mattel execs, Alan kind of just being ""there"") and the resolution of the movie isn't as satisfying as it could be (the Kens are basically back to square one with being oppressed by the barbies' matriarchy). 

I really enjoyed this film a lot. I love the absurd elements, the surreal humor, the focus on existential and philosophical themes. The set design was absolutely gorgeous and I love that it was all practical effects and set pieces too. But I think it could have benefitted from going all in on one of the two plot points outline above rather than trying to fit them both in a two hour move. Much like Margot's barbie in the film I think this movie was struggling to figure out who it really was and never quite got there.",2023-07-23 18:11:42,19,movies,Fact0ry0fSadness,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

756,"This movie was a lot of fun and it told it's story in a unique and thoughtful way. Gave it like a 9/10

I've been looking around at commentary and I'm starting to think it's biggest failing is simply falling victim to the cultural climate we are in (don't worry, keep reading.) Barbie takes a modern perspective and uses it to apply analysis and critique of a magical realism Barbie world. If we take it at that, it really is a superb film. 

But when I look at commentary for the movie I'm consistently seeing two complaints on the opposite ends of a spectrum 1) The film did not do enough to seriously unpack patriarchy and misogyny and critique them in a meaningful and impactful way or 2) The film did too much to unpack patriarchy and misogyny  and critique them in a meaningful (or disingenuous) and impactful way.

I think people have unwittingly gotten caught up in the narrative that this film was gonna change the world and lead to the next wave of new feminist theory. If you just let it be a fun, yet intelligently written, movie there is so much less to be disappointed with.

757,"I have such mixed feelings about this movie. The cast were amazing. This was possibly one of the best all-round performances I've seen, with Ryan Gosling stealing the show in literally every scene he was in. The direction and set design were also great. They went hard on the style and it really did work, particularly for the Barbieland sections.

But the writing was... just so hit-and-missy. The pacing felt all over the place, sometimes jumping from scene to scene like it wanted to skip through them, with scenes essentially just being rapid fire jokes with no downtime. Then we had scenes that dragged on for way too long and slowed everything down. The stuff in Matel felt like this, as well as the montage of saving all the Barbies from the brainwashing. I felt like I shouldn't have been bored, but I really was during that montage. And, on that note, i get to the messaging of the film. 

I really wanted to go into this with an open mind but it's hard not to see the issues with the theming, since they had the subtlety of a brick. Men are stupid. That seemed to be the main theme of this movie. I think this works for the Kens. All the Barbies and Kens are these weird, absurd caricatures and I think that absolutely works. Playing the hypercompetent Barbies against the dumb himbo Kens was a good commentary on how these toys are actually seen in real life. I liked it. The issue comes when the 'real life' men are... also all weird caricatures. 

Will Ferrell and all his goons (fun fact, 5 of the 11 members of Mattel's [current Board of Directors](https://corporate.mattel.com/investors/corporate-governance/board-of-directors) are women, but let's ignore that, because it doesn't fit what we want to say) and the construction workers and the cops and just *every male character* in the real world was just a weird strawman. And, again, I could get this as a general style, but the real world women *weren't* treated like this. Sasha, America Ferrera, Ruth, the doctor Ken talks to and the mum Ken talks to were all played as normal, real characters for the Barbie cast to bounce off. 

It just sits as *weird* to me the contrast between how the women were treated (real, complex characters with motivations who we're meant to care about) and the men (weird goofballs who almost universally exist to be the set up and/or butt of a joke). Oh, and a special note to the 'joke' where a brainwashed Barbie claims that the brainwashing made her feel 'overly invested in the Zack Snyder cut of Justice League,' which is not only already a dated and not particularly funny joke, but also just a *terribly* flowing line. In fact, a lot of the quips were pretty awkwardly written and could have used another draft.

Beyond that, the moments where a character stopped to look at the camera and rant about how hard it is to be a woman felt hollow and preachy especially as, again, Ken's own insecurities and issues, which largely mirrored what was being said by America Ferrera, were played off as silly. Not only did these moments feel very soapbox-y but they were just... boring to me.

There is a lot to like about this film. There were a good few parts that made me laugh (the Pink! song reprise with the new lyrics was genuinely great) but there's also quite a few parts that made me roll my eyes or check my phone because it just felt like the writer using a character to rant, which isn't particularly entertaining to me.

This felt like it was going for the EEAAO brand of 'absurdist humour meets meaningful and emotional themes' and, to me, it failed. Because EEAAO used it's absurdism to carry it's themes, while Barbie stopped it's absurdism to monologue it's themes at you. 

Also, the Kens deserved more. The movie seriously took an abused underclass of citizens, had them revolt and take over, and then had the status quo restored and actively mocked them for being against it. Then Helen Mirren made some sort of weird revenge quip.",2023-07-25 16:22:54,19,movies,Magmas,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

763,"maybe this is dumb to say.... but i feel like because the roles are reversed, it reinforces how women are treated in society today. like... in barbieland there is a group in women's position and everyone is totally ok with that. its even made out to be something that isnt bad. there is no justice for the group in the shawdow, which is women in the real world. feminism is wanting women to be equal to men, not better. i feel like this movie fuels the rage of those intolerant to learn what feminism really is, because there are portrayals likw this.

764,"First of all it took me days to figure out what bothered me about this movie. I had been thinking about it nonstop so that is a sign that this is very important movie. Also there was plenty of moments that had me laughing out loud, and I mean like really laughing, so I can't say that I hated this movie because I didn't, but I also didn't love it like I was hoping to. I did not find it very deep and several important moments irritated me, like America's speech in the middle about the contradictions of being a woman (and I am woman). While true, I found it cringeworthy and extremely lazy writing, like ripped from a twitter rant five years ago. 

I finally figured out why the speech, and most of the movie, bothered me so much. Hear me out:

I have mentioned the the film didn't feel deep (honestly it felt like it should be called Feminism for Outer space Aliens). Part of this is because they way they stop the Barbies from being ""brainwashed"" by patriarchy is to give them the speech. But the truth is the Barbies have never lived in the real world and only experienced patriarchy for like a day, and they even allow it to happen! Of course they explain this with one convenient line about them having no defenses to it like the Native Americans did with smallpox or something. What?? Ok...Anyway, so they're broken out of the spell by have these contradictions explained to them even though they'd have NO concept of them whatsoever. Meanwhile, we have an AMAZING start to the plot: Barbie (because of America's character) is thinking about death. Why did they drop this?!!! What a missed opportunity! IF they could have Leaned into this universal, existential feeling then they could have framed patriarchy within mortality and therefore shown it to be the complete waste of time it really is. We're all gonna die, why be such an asshole? Etc. Then they could have explained THAT to the Barbies AND the Kens, too, and it would have felt so much deeper and more universal.

Also like many people mentioned it did feel hypocritical to me in many ways, and this could have helped that, too, I think. I honestly think Gerwig and Baumbach did the best they could under the circumstances probably (Matel trying to create a Marvel universe, essentially, and become hella rich, while trying to be cool and culturally relevant) so I don't fault them very much. The film is very much worth seeing. I do also wish Ken had a better ending. That he could have self-actualized a little more. Ryan Gosling was so funny in that part and they kind of did him dirty. He should have realized his dream of working with horses.",2023-08-06 00:52:58,19,movies,Simple_Ingenuity2494,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
765,"(Spoiler Alert)

I loved the costume design and some of the messaging was great, but I have this awful unshakeable feeling of disappointment I think? Im still processing. 

Some things that stood out to me - what was the whole thing on cellulite? What was the point of that? Barbie literally escapes to the real world to ‚Äúfix‚Äù her awful cellulite and flat feet? Then when she gets into the real world and compliments an older woman for being beautiful - it felt so‚Ä¶contradictory? 

Another thing that keeps bugging me is the way the society kind of ostracized the pregnant and weird Barbies. Isn‚Äôt the point of a female-empowered society to empower all types of women?

Lastly I totally thought the ending was going somewhere else. I loved that Mattel in the real world was grey and depressing, lacking color and ran by all men. I 100% thought that the end was going to have Margot Robbie walking into the Mattel corporation and seeing the grey cubicles turn to color and women being on the corporate board and Barbie ultimately taking a hand in actually empowering young women like she always thought Barbie could do. 

Maybe I was expecting too much? Or maybe I just didn‚Äôt understand some of these pieces, but at least the movie was a fun watch and it hit some good points in its messaging.",2023-07-24 00:26:27,19,movies,Pigwidgeon_,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
766,"i feel like a betrayer to all womankind - i did not like the movie üò≠ i was super super excited for it because i'm a girlie girl, i love greta gerwig, i love margot robbie, and i love a good social commentary. 

i went into barbie expecting to get a poignant story wrapped up in pretty pink packaging. and the packaging sure was pretty!!! the barbies are stunning and the set is gorgeous. but the monologue that made everyone cry did not resonate with me at all

maybe it's bc i'm not born in the west, but my experience with misogyny is more like i'm expected to be Docile Wife as opposed to Skinny Girlboss. to me, a life where i'm expected to be a career-driven leader seems pretty out of reach. in my world i struggle with all of my accomplishments being dismissed as nothing. i can't relate to people having high expectations of me, or asking me to account for mens mistakes, or needing me to be a kind leader, bc no one expects me to be anything really",2023-07-28 17:58:34,19,movies,98_h,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
767,"Honestly the more I think about the movie the more realise how the messages aren't as simple as it seems and it's way more satirical and self aware then anyone sees.

This is just my take from the film and it's clearly polysemic.

But i think the films real thesis is ""Barbie solves misogyny is a dumb idea"" and it's laughing at that.

It's a film that is fundamentally against itself and the entire idea of corporate feminism that brand is built on. Multiple times in the film Barbieland talks about how Barbie has made the world a better place for women. Which is clearly ironic and a laughable notion. The film constantly makes ideas like girl power and patriarchy the butt of the joke. All the ideas about gender presented throughout the film besides maybe Gloria's and Ruth's points were laughably stupid. Because the characters are brainless dolls made for 4 year olds. No matter what Barbie does people are not happy because that is reality.

A normal non self aware Barbie film would have ended the film with Barbie instantly fixing all issues and instantly granting gender equality and making everyone happy. Which the film was parodying with it's ending but in the real world feminism doesn't work like that. The audience is supposed to laugh at the Barbies' solution, not agree with it. Because in the real world feminism is really hard, it's complicated and messy and often does seem hypocritical like the Barbies are presented. And most importantly feminism takes time, lots of time, huge eras of history and it's still not sorted out for everyone. It's not something you can put a pink bow on and call a day like brands like Matel would want you to think.

This is a movie that portrays it's own studio as a bunch of bumbling fools who want to push feminism above everything else despite not understanding at all. Which matches so much of modern media.

I honestly feel the film is more Anti-Corporate Feminism than it is Anti-men. Whilst at the same time being a piece of corporate feminism. Which lots on people on both sides of the feminism debate are failing to see because they are incapable of seeing feminism as something that's not perfect or evil. Which is why I compare the movie to Starship Troopers which people thought had a simplistic view on war that it really didn't.",2023-07-25 22:47:30,19,movies,mattsmithreddit,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

I also liked how everyone in Barbieland wanted to move on and not forget everything they went through. I think it was a good reminder that struggle and difficulty is something to inspire you and keep you from making the same mistakes. 

The only thing I wish is that the Barbies and Kens were equal at the end- maybe that‚Äôs what they were trying to say when President Barbie told them they could have positions in lower court?? Also, I‚Äôm still wondering where the Kens sleep lol. 

I also wish that at the end the Barbies valued the Kens more, but I LOOOOVED how Margot Robbie Barbie helped Ken understand that he needed to find identity outside of her. I thought that was such a good message.

One of the speeches about the contradictions of being a woman was taken nearly verbatim from one of my favorite tiktokers. I hope they give her credit. Anyway, Ryan Gosling stole the show.

779,"I loved this movie so much, and it‚Äôs so interesting how people have their differing perspectives on some of the role reversing that happened in Barbieland. 

A lot of people are teasing the filmmaker about making the Kens ‚Äúunlikable,‚Äù but people still liked the Kens. I don‚Äôt think Greta‚Äôs point at all was to make the Kens un-likeable. The kens are very much naive, and don‚Äôt desire to have power over the women in Barbieland, but just to be paid attention to, and valued to the extent that the Barbies are valued. It‚Äôs the same feeling that women feel in the real world, and the basis of feminism except reversed. 

Sure the Barbies can be mean towards the Kens, but it never even goes so far to the extent that real women are treated like in the real world. They just lack attention/appreciation, and in the end Barbie apologizes for her behavior, and assures Ken that he doesn‚Äôt need hyper-masculinity or the patriarchy to be his own person. She assures him that he can find himself. The song penned by Billie Eilish ‚Äúwhat was I made for‚Äù applies to many characters in Barbie, but especially both to Barbie AND Ken. They‚Äôre uncertain of their place in the world, and who they are. 

Even the Mattel employees aren‚Äôt evil. They all come to an equal understanding, and allow Barbie to live in the real world, and keep Barbieland the way the folks want it to be.

Plus they make the Barbie world seem like a reverse gender version of the real world, but then bring up stuff like the Supreme Court in Barbie world being all female when that's not true in the real world so the parallels don't even work unless you exaggerate the sexism of the real world.

796,"This movie was a little too meta for me. It makes it hard to tell what the stakes are if you don't have any understanding of what's possible. I know I shouldn't take it that seriously but it is about serious topics. I also understand everyone's problem with the last act. The worst part is when the little girl goes ""What does Barbie get?"" as an extremely unnatural way to set up Barbie themestating to the audience. It reminds me of lines in poorly written musicals where you set up a song by asking a character how he feels. 

Ryan Gosling looks old for this. He's only 42 but he does stand out among a crowd of guys in their early 30s. It felt to me like his story was a woman's view of what masculinity is. Beer and muscle cars I get, but horses? Are horses supposed to be a man thing? They can be, but they can just as easily be for girls. 

What even is a boyfriend in Barbieland? Ken doesn't get to sleep over and Barbie never kisses him. How is his relationship with her any different from her relationship to the other Kens? 

Closer to Fine vs Push. I like Push a lot, but this movie sure doesn't. This movie would have been worth seeing just to watch Ryan Gosling do his Rob Thomas impression. Does anybody ""Anyway here's Wonderwall"" Push? Is that a thing? I guess it's easy enough to play. They sang Closer to Fine like four times in this movie and nobody *ever* tried to do the low split. That was very unsatisfying. 

I liked how the opening Lizzo song changed lyrics when Barbie started going wrong. Otherwise the original music does not do anything for me. Especially the Ken one.  

One direction they could have taken this, that they shouldn't have but it's funny to think about, is the Barbies realizing that their jobs are fake. Doctor Barbie doesn't actually heal Ken or have any medical knowledge, she's just a doctor to show girls in real world they can become a doctor. They live in a world where nobody actually needs to do work. Another thought I had that I'm sure I'm not alone in thinking is that nobody acted concerned that a strange pink cowboy woman was walking into a middle school and acting way too friendly with a random student. I feel like the reaction would be less ""Barbie is sexist"" and more ""this woman is a creep."" 

My favorite jokes:

* All the physical comedy in the first part with Barbie drinking from empty cups, the fridge being a sticker, the pools being solid, etc.

* Ken being exposed to masculinity by going up an escalator in Century City and seeing a giant screen display of Bill Clinton

* The two times in the movie they mention genitalia

798,"It didn‚Äôt live up to the hype for me. I love Little Women and Lady Bird so much and had high expectations. Every time the script and plot leaned into the humanness of it all, I loved it. But then it would pull away and become silly again. There should have been more about the mother/daughter and less about Barbieland. Why were Sasha and her mom trying to save Barbie? Barbie is a toy and is fictional. Barbie should have been working to help the Real World. Barbie should have been a vessel to explore mother/daughter relationships, and the patriarchy/gender roles in the Real World. Some of the movie was really funny but a lot of the humor was very meta. It felt like you had to be in on the joke in order to get the joke. I was so happy when I picked up on America ferrera‚Äôs husband saying ‚ÄúSi se puede!!‚Äù Millennials and anyone that grew up with disney channel would get it. Some humor went over my head.

801,"I absolutely loved the first half of the film. I loved the sets, costumes, music, the outrageousness, the humour, the fun. Ryan Gosling was amazing as always. But I did not enjoy the second half of the film, for the most part (I still adored those essential elements I mentioned, like the sets, as they continued to shine throughout the whole film).¬†

My first problem with the second half is that the pacing really did not fit my taste. It slowed down a lot and the contemplative and deep moments went too far beyond for my liking. It felt very piled on, and definitely not the less-is-more style of the first half that I was really enjoying.¬†

Furthermore, Greta Gerwig‚Äôs particular feelings about womanhood, feminism, and gender just don‚Äôt resonate with mine anymore. I have grown a lot over the past few years, and my feelings have changed. I think we need to stop pointing fingers at men. It‚Äôs just pointless, especially as our society continues to push so much heavy messaging and expectation of traditional (harmful) masculinity onto their shoulders. Plus, a binary view of humanity is simply outdated and incorrect. And I just want to clarify that I know Greta isn‚Äôt trying to point fingers at men here. My impression of her message is that it‚Äôs time to free ourselves from all gender stereotypes, which is great. But the entire speech from America Ferrera, as well as the subplot of the Barbies taking back Barbieland and saying they ‚Äúdisinfected‚Äù the dream houses after the Ken‚Äôs were there just felt like more stereotyping.

Even though it‚Äôs happening at a glacial pace, Canadian society, at least, is making real strides towards liberation from gender stereotypes. We need to invigorate this movement by promoting Men‚Äôs Health funding and campaigns, discontinuing the use of the term ‚Äútoxic masculinity‚Äù and switch it out for ‚Äúharmful/outdated masculine stereotypes‚Äù. We need to let the men in our lives know, as often as we can, that we don‚Äôt expect or need them to be strong all the time. We want them to feel connected to their emotions and express them. We don‚Äôt need them to make a lot of money. We don‚Äôt need them to just ‚Äútough it out‚Äù through injuries and hardships. And so on.¬†

Feminism means equality of all genders. So make sure to check yourself that you‚Äôre treating everyone in your life like another human, and work on edging out any conscious or unconscious gender biases you have. These are my beliefs, and watching Barbie really rubbed me the wrong way, so I can only think that Greta‚Äôs beliefs are just too different than mine for my liking.¬†

If the film had just been fun; a chase through the real world to capture Barbie and Ken, epic musical numbers, and hilarious references to the dolls and how we played with them, then it would‚Äôve been a 5 for me.",2023-07-23 06:26:25,18,movies,maborosi97,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

804,"I enjoyed the movie (loved the first half, liked the second) but my main gripe with it is that at the end of the day the main criticism that people throw at barbies and mattel wasn't deeply explored: **the beauty standards and body norms set by barbie dolls.**

Sasha, the teenager who used to play with the barbie, basically fits all those beauty stereotypes. It would have felt very different if we had seen a girl who did not fit those body norms making the comments that she did, and showing how her life had been impacted by the cultural expectations that toys like barbies set on young girls. 

Plus, when she throws her criticism at Barbie (that she was a bad influence on girls growing up by setting unrealistic beauty stereotypes) what we see is  Barbie crying and saying it was never her intention to make anyone feel bad. Making Barbie a real person with feelings sort of acts as a way to make us feel bad about Sasha criticising her directly, as that is like criticizing an individual woman rather than a object, which is a way to make those comments hit differently and feel less pertinent.

The rest of the movie is an exploration of the effects of patriarchy and of male toxic masculinity over both men and women, but it never directly or deeply addressed the question of how body standards set by barbies affect women's body image and, most importantly, **what should be changed by Mattel to prevent that**. 

Fundamentally, the whole patriarchy plot and *Real World vs Barbie World* just felt like a way to discuss those topics in a very generic way that doesn't address the specificities of how Barbie influences young girls and just sort of throws blame at the entire society and at the 'patriarchy' without recognising blame in the brand. 

I get that this is a movie made by Mattel and obviously they wouldn't want to criticise the product directly, but it still feels frustrating as a viewer to see them trying to escape responsability in any serious way.

At the end of the day, if you go to most shopping malls today to the dolls sections, basically all the barbies you will find there are still the ""Stereotypical"" Barbie. Even in the world of the movie, which was obviously trying to be inclusive, you look at the barbies in barbieland, almost all of them were gorgeous, and basically all of them were very thin, with only one or two exceptions. 

I really wish brands would make real concerted efforts to create truly body positive products rather than shifiting responsibility or simply virtue signaling.",2023-07-23 21:21:02,18,movies,eatingvmint,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

I think the film missed an opportunity to extend and explain a little more about America's speech. It's we, women who project all those expectations on ourselves, it's not just ""the patriarchy.""  I keep myself down. I hate myself in clothes. I am not thin enough. It's me, I'm the problem.

815,"Fucking terrible ending made this a 5/10.

Hollywood‚Äôs extreme aversion to ‚Äúguy gets girl‚Äù basically ruined this movie. Ken was showing Barbie how much it sucks to be in the position he was in, they should have come to an understanding and finally kissed, and shared the dreamhouse. Would that have been so wrong? Maybe give Ken an actual fucking job instead of just ‚Äúbeach‚Äù?

Instead Ken comes to a random epiphany that‚Äôs he‚Äôs ‚Äúkenough‚Äù and goes right back to being a homeless, loveless beach bum (even more loveless now that now his Barbie has fuckin LEFT Barbie world so he doesn‚Äôt even have a Barbie‚Ä¶just realized that). 

Barbie decides to go to the real world because now she‚Äôs too awakened to just live in Barbie world I guess‚Ä¶and she magically gets a vagina. Cool. Whatever. I mean we established that men are evil and Barbie shows zero interest in them so what the hell is she supposed to do with it? Also shouldn‚Äôf we see her thriving a little more in the real world? Maybe get a job as a motivational speaker or something? She seems to want to help women and yet her ending is just ‚Äúhey got my vagina whoopie‚Äù instead of something more constructive and meaningful.

Also the fear of death was never addressed. Like she had it, and it got her out of Barbie world, but now why does she not have it anymore? Like that was never resolved. In fact now that she went from being an idea to a real person shouldn‚Äôt the fear of death be stronger than ever? As an idea she was nearly immortal because for her to die literally everyone in the world would have to forget about Barbie, which could take thousands of years. As a real person she‚Äôs gunna be dead in like 40-50 years. So shouldn‚Äôt she be MORE worried about death now? This movie has like 1,000 loose ends.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just Ken‚Äù was an absolute banger though. Justifies the movie‚Äôs entire existence just so we could get that one song.",2023-07-26 08:13:08,18,movies,seabedurchin,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

and something else i‚Äôd like to add is i dont understand why they go back to the matriarchy at the end, because when they said something about not letting kens have a higher up job in society, when surely the end goal for barbieland is equality?

830,"Thoroughly enjoyed the first act, but as the film went on it got worse and worse for my tastes.

The premise is wonderful: that this idea of a utopian Barbieland of plastic feminism is actually dystopian. So to actually empower women you need to go to the real world and learn to deal with the fear of change in life, depression, mother-daughter relationships, fear of ageing, etc. It's classical Bildungsroman with a very contemporary injection of perspectives. All of that was really good and shows how you can be whimsical but still tackle mature themes.

But then the film nosedives into disappointment. The mother and daughter relationship arc just gets abandoned without proper development. The Barbies' tactic of fixing Barbieland is by having them act out the worst type of stereotypically female emotional manipulation on the Kens. And the end-state of Barbieland is just a revert back to the plastic hyper-feminist dystopian dreamland where you wake up and do the same thing every day. The only characters that get ""liberated"" are Stereotypical Barbie and, very marginally, Gosling-Ken, who no longer has the singular identity of ""Beach"". (But he's still homeless! Have we not learnt anything after 2 hours of very blatant gender politics exploration?)

And then that whole Pinocchio ending just happens. The Barbie dreamhouse TV show is so much better than this disappointment.",2023-07-26 06:02:28,18,movies,JockstrapCummies,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

835,"Barbie‚Äôs trailer and all the promotions were pointing in directions of it bra comedy and a goofy movie with barbie and Ken struggling to adapt with the human ways and find there way home.


But in reality everything was rushed and no character had any development and even the plot had mo plot. It was kinda of a message.

The idea behind the movie (what I took) was that no single authority is good for the society and ppl coz if only one type of ppl govern the ppl that have been left out don‚Äôt feel a part of their own land.

Will Ferrell and Ryan gosling were the only funny bit in the movie

The movie didn‚Äôt need to say women men every 10 seconds coz it was getting annoying. 

I really was excited to to see Greta, being a fan of her work and being one of my favourite directors whose movie I would watch no questions asked. Was kinda of a disappointment

I would say it was  a 6/10,with Margot being 10/10 and Ryan being 10/10 and the plot being 3/10",2023-08-10 16:25:46,18,movies,Aggravating-Lack1738,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

I was fine with the distraction plot line but once they were all at the campfires and guitars part and the Barbies intentionally ignored the Kens and tried to inspire jealously... that's just fucked up. Hurting someone to further your own gains is not right.

I think the ending should've had Kens going off to create Kendom next to Barbieland or ended with Kens and Barbies in equal position of powers. To those of you saying ""it shouldn't have ended like a fairytale"", I call bullshit. The movie spent the entire time hammering in the fact that Barbieland was *not* the real world. It would have been perfectly acceptable to have it end idyllically. The way it currently ended made the Barbie's all seem like hypocrites for denouncing patriarchy and yet using underhanded tactics to ensure matriarchy. ""Having Barbieland emulate the real-world but backwards"" might be a wake up call to the few dudes who actually realize what the message is (Women are still not represented equally in positions of power in the real world despite claims of equality) but by and large I think most men and women who see the movie are going to miss this message and just be put off by the glaringly obvious hypocrisy instead.",2023-07-23 03:48:18,18,movies,winteredDog,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

840,"I have been excited about this movie ever since I realized that Greta Gerwig was directing it. Ryan Gosling as Ken was just the cherry on the ice cream sundae. 

The opening scene was killer and perfect. Then as Barbie's world was set up, I started to get a little nervous- was this movie going to be too full-blown Barbie? Not what I expected with Gerwig at the helm- and then Barbie's existential crisis began. Perfect. 

I thought that the movie was great- cinematic and fun, just like I had hoped. I've been a fan of Gerwig's dance choreography style ever since I saw her performance with the Arcade Fire for the YouTube Music Awards... and it was so fun to see a couple of those moves in one of the dance sequences for this film. 

One of my favorite sequences was when Barbie was being chased in the maze of cubicles- sign me up for silly stylized chaos. I used to watch musicals when I was younger, and Gerwig is definitely reminding me that I need to revisit the genre. 

Ryan Gosling was so much fun to watch as Ken- the way that he sang and played guitar for Barbie was just... over the top in such a relatable way. Not to mention his performance of the Ken song- he really did find his Kenergy. 

I can see how this movie might not be for everybody. I love Gerwig's work, but she definitely is part of the indie crowd, and she wanted to make a Barbie film, not a Barbie movie. Barbie thinking about death and humanity? It's not a kid's movie, which is a little confusing. But for me- it was just what I hoped for. I was surprised at how emotional watching this movie was for me, honestly. Didn't expect that. 

Side note: I watched this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2rNnOGfmv0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2rNnOGfmv0) interview and Gerwig talks about some of the films that inspired her. It's a fun watch.",2023-07-22 15:08:52,18,movies,bakedveldtland,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

848,"This just didn‚Äôt work for me. The first 20 minutes when they are in the Barbie world was great. They hit all the notes and understood the satire of the movie. Quickly it spirals to some preachy self righteous lecture circuit about Margot Robbie not feeling fulfilled or wanting to be all powerful? I was confused by the messaging and thought they didn‚Äôt really know what they wanted to accomplish or realistically say? Should women rule the world or should men? They throw in a Ken find your own path effort at the end but this is after we‚Äôve seen the Barbies saying under no circumstance should Kens think to hard past the beach. They had ideas and wrote around them instead of knowing how to accomplish their story Just wasn‚Äôt for me, I will be on the short side of this.

Robbie looks like Barbie and Ryan Gosling steals the show and looks as if he was made of chiseled well sculpted plastic. The Will Ferrell subplot is unknowingly confounding  to me, just why? The Ferrell schtick is TIRED and again what was that entire subplot about, it had no pull to it and if you eliminate it completely nothing is lost. Even American Ferraro and her wiser then thou kid was a story that they didn‚Äôt really flush out past, ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs get back so we can get to the Ken takeover story line‚Äô. In the end the mom gives a speech and suddenly Barbies rule the world again? Which is the counter opposite of what they opposed with the Kens rule? That‚Äôs the best they could come up with? It seems they want to say: be yourself, but be what‚Äôs been designed for you to be(after all the Barbies profession are predetermined), and don‚Äôt let mean rule, but really women shouldn‚Äôt fully rule either? Idk, and when all else is lost Rhea Pearlman will speak to us, prolonging the movie for 10 unneeded minutes, about the joys of the human species‚Ä¶ But wasn‚Äôt Barbielands messaging to be who you are which was a Barbie? 

The Ken thing with Barbie not being interested in him is confusing also‚Ä¶ so if you are a noble prize winner that‚Äôs what you are. If you are president, that‚Äôs what you are. But if you are literally Barbie and Ken, we‚Äôll Barbie doesn‚Äôt need to be with Ken. Which fine ok, but doesn‚Äôt that mean the noble prize winner should be able to be anything she wants? Idk. 

In a day where I saw the story of the man who created the atomic bomb and Barbie I really didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be lectured more by the later.

850,"Watched it last night.

Loved about 75% of it but I feel like the writing fell apart at the end.

I didn't like the scooby doo style chase scenes in the cubicles and the executives being stopped by a turnstyle. I felt like they were trying to make the real world more serious compared to the imaginary world and these scenes kinda muddied the waters and erased any threat the executives posed because you knew they were stupid. Which might be why they basically wrote them out of the movie after that. (they were right behind them going into the imaginary world but somehow didn't show up until days after the others did?)

The Kens, Allen, and weird Barbie were definitely the highlight of the movie. 

Overall I'd say it's a 7.5/10",2023-07-27 17:32:04,18,movies,Shrabster33,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
851,"FINALLY got to see Barbie last night and managed to avoid all spoilers and most trailers. First off, I'm a middle aged dude and a big fan of Gerwig's work (especially Lady Bird). I prepped for this movie by watching Little Women, American in Paris, and Singing in the Rain (A+ movie, btw). 

Overall, I thought this movie was a great time and one I could recommend to almost anybody (similar to this year's Spiderverse). I thought the self-awareness and Gerwig's brand of humor was well suited for this type of project. Most reviews I read echo this, but I think this movie was spot on when it was in Barbieland and has an incredible opening act. It gets super messy when it enters the real world tho, specifically any scenes that involve the board. It started to feel like one big commercial for Mattel, Warner Brothers, and the Chevy Blazer EV, which had me afraid we were entering Space Jam 2 territory. It also didn't help that a good majority of the songs made for this movie were by Top 40 artists (Lizzo, Khalid, Dua Lipa, etc). That's not to say licensed music is a bad thing in a movie, I just found the execution distracting here, at least in the first half of the movie. Minor complaints aside, I thought weird Barbie was hilarious and Mckinnon crushed it, America Ferrera's monologue was great and is a great summary of the movies theme, and both Robbie and Gosling were absolutely perfect for their roles. I think if you were to cut out all of the Mattel board stuff and either flesh out the mother/daughter relationship a bit more or just remove the sharing memories with Barbie thing, this would be a much tighter movie. But that didn't stop me from loving it! I mean, it's a popcorn flick with actual effort put into it, so credit is due. 

If you know what a Barbie is, I think you should check it out sometime. It's fun! 4/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è",2023-08-01 12:52:34,17,movies,LincolnLogs42,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
852,"I had fun and I thought it was really funny at times.

It's also a movie about Barbie dolls. Like, you could imagine a little girl in our day and age coming up with a scenario on saving Barbieland from the Kens.

And I think that's fun.

I don't think the double standards will age well though, but it's a movie for women and girls about Barbie. There's a message there and it rings true in many ways. That said all men being portrayed as dizzy, bumbling idiots didn't sit right with me anymore than it sits right with me watching old media and seeing girls being portrayed as dizzy, bumbling idiots.",2023-07-21 18:39:41,17,movies,giddycocks,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

It wasn‚Äôt a bad movie. The jokes were meh. The plot was confusing. The rules of the Barbieverse didn‚Äôt make much sense.

Maybe feminist-leaning women and/or persons, but even so.. it didn‚Äôt say or stand for anything I haven‚Äôt heard before. And it seemed to borrow a lot from the Lego movie‚Äîincluding Will Ferrel. I‚Äôve liked Greta Gerwig‚Äôs previous films, but this one just felt.. eh. Forgettable.

861,"While the plot flounders a bit, and I agree that the Will Ferrell/CEO thing was superfluous and didn't really add anything, I think rather than criticize I would like to credit Gerwig for accomplishing more as a director for the ""feminist"" movement with this one movie than has been accomplished in 30 years.

In summary,  what Barbie successfully does, in my opinion, through the great power of social satire, is illuminate the fact that men are not even capable of the great subterfuge historically attributed to them.  The movie holds a lens up to that fact that, in seeking the enemy, it is perhaps not men, but women themselves who give continue to give away their power by playing into objectification.   

Robbie and Gosling play their roles with just the right balance of humor and cultural awareness.  Have always loved Gosling, who has the courage to laugh at himself and all ""Kens"" and steals the show.  Rather than laugh and talk about how funny it was, and how on point, which it absolutely was, I hope it reminds women to choose not to conform or be objectified every day.  The indicator of great art is that it stimulates discussion.",2023-08-16 21:07:26,17,movies,Cold_Guide_8308,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
862,"The lessons about humanity, compassion, noticing the other person, what it's like to be a woman and a man, and how both sexes have their own struggles and their pain deserve to be noticed, acknowledged, and praised. The final scene where Barbie both metaphorically and literally grows up and decides to become human was tearjerking, definitely the top highlight of this movie.

But damn, if most of the good stuff just gets drowned in the approach of ""Telling"" instead of ""showing"". Ken's patriarchal rules that came from the place of wanting to be respected for who he/they are was a good story, telling every second sentence how ""patriarchy is bad"" was not. There are moments where this really original and refreshing movie becomes some sort of lecture which is quite possibly the most boring way to show things. Exposition by info dumps rarely ends well for the consumer, it makes the whole experience really shallow.

And I get that overall this movie was partially a satire of many modern things but Christ, those Mattel executives were just... ugh. Completely unfunny and unnecessary, they brought nothing but annoyance. Even if the idea behind them was laughing at capitalism as a whole and pointing out consumptionism, I think there could've been a better way of showing that. Or definitely the more funny way.

Overall, a solid 7. The first 2/3 of the movie is a real mixed bag of good and bad, the last third made up for the movie's shortcomings. Barbie's conversation with Ruth, the war/dance-off scene, or just everything with that mother's presence in the Barbie World was on top.",2023-09-24 17:52:45,17,movies,telepek25,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

The part that really ticked me off was Barbies plan to seduce and manipulate Ken. What is the messaging here for young girls? Toxic behavior gets you what you want? So irresponsible and just dumb, lazy writing. 

Lacked a compelling villain. Nope ‚Äúpatriarchy‚Äù does not cut it. I would‚Äôve enjoyed something that expanded on weird Barbie, possibly an evil Barbie for Ken to team up with and go head to head with stereotypical Barbie. Throw in a bunch of other toy minions too. But a woman versus woman conflict wouldn‚Äôt fit the agenda of this movie. 

You have to go 1000% on the absurdity factor with this type of film or it falls flat. It was so flat, I was itching to leave the theater.",2023-07-24 07:44:07,17,movies,hodgepodgerealness,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
865,"Finally watched last night. Slept on it, read some reviews and now, I've come to the conclusion that this movie was just a money grab. A giant advertisement which skewed decisions being made with it's creation. They had an ending in their mind and worked backwards to make that ending possible. 

The real world is just as ridiculous as the barbie world and must be set in some other world besides earth. Maybe it's supposed to be created how a child sees the world at a young age? Possibly, but Will Ferrell needing a key card for the gate just lost me. Worst way possible to fill a plot hole. 

Overall, if you put real world realities aside, and see that this barbie movie is strictly between barbie and ""Gloria"", America Ferreras character, it doesn't have to be a perfect fit for your own perceptions. Gloria has a dark side which comes out with her drawings of barbie. Watching the movie through her characters eyes does make this experience a bit more enjoyable. 

Sure there are feminist and sexist tones throughout, but they were so ridiculous that it couldn't be what the movie was really trying to say. It's a story based on a doll created for women and they had to play the part. Anything else just wouldn't be true to the doll. 

If you see this for what it is, which I mentioned before, as a giant advertisement, you will enjoy the movie way more than if you try to compare it to your own life and perceptions",2023-11-19 19:00:12,17,movies,Think-Watercress25,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

868,"I liked the set design for Barbieland, and a lot of the initial story in Barbieland although it felt a bit odd. When Barbie was in the real world and feeling emotions and seeing human connection was beautiful, Margot Robbies illustrating Barbie feeling the emotions was great and Ryan Gosling performed great with what he was given

I felt the feminist stuff was too loud, I'm 100% not saying there shouldn't have been any feminist messages but show don't tell comes to mind and the opening monologue and Gloria's speech and the bringing the other Barbies back to their senses were screaming ( but i believe that was the point!).

I think the last third was a bit of a mess and lost me when they got back to Barbieland it felt like they had a checklist of messages they wanted to tell and squeezed them in at the detriment of the film as a whole.


I think the film would have benefitted if the girls/ and or Barbie stayed to help in the real world as Barbieland was meant to mirror how the dolls were being played with and I think the film was at its best there.",2023-08-04 14:09:58,17,movies,HappyMeerkat,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

Gosling and Robbie play off each other perfectly, the mom and daughter characters were actually quite relatable, Kate McKinnon‚Äôs Weird Barbie stole every scene, and most importantly, the humour and political messages are well balanced, so the movie doesn‚Äôt swing too hard into unfocused comedy or heavy-handed preaching.

873,"Here's an article I found to be interesting. Thoughts?

https://www.nationalreview.com/2023/07/conservatives-are-getting-barbie-wrong/

For those who can't access it:

>A confession, upfront: I probably would never have seen Barbie had it not come out the same weekend as Oppenheimer, thereby allowing me to do the full ‚ÄúBarbenheimer‚Äù last Thursday night. My review of Oppenheimer has already appeared. Of the Barbehneimer experience itself, I will say little more other than that it was exhausting.

>But exhaustion is not why it has taken a few days for me to assess Barbie fully. It is, rather, that Barbie is far less straightforward than Oppenheimer, with multiple interpretive and thematic layers. Oppenheimer is not an uncomplicated film, but Barbie is itself a highly sophisticated one - and one that many conservatives are almost certainly getting wrong.

>The story of Barbie is deceptively simple. A Barbie (Margot Robbie, as ""Stereotypical Barbie""), suddenly finds her idyllic life in Barbieland, the separate realm in which the Barbie dolls real-world people play with are represented anthropomorphically, disrupted by thoughts of death and other deviations from perfect Barbiedom. A visit to Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), thus labeled because she has been marred by being played with a little too hard, sends her on a journey to our world to find the owner at the root of her discontent. And a Ken (Ryan Gosling), in a ploy for Barbie's attention (without which he can barely function), ends up a stowaway. While there, Barbie and Ken experience a reversal of sorts. Barbie discovers that she has not, in fact, empowered the world, and Ken appears to discover the glories of the ""patriarchy"" that dominates our reality. Shenanigans and further trips back and forth between Barbieland and our world ensue.

>The emerging conservative take on Barbie seems to be that it is a shallow, man-hating, and repulsive screed, an assessment that probably owes a great deal to the fact that Barbieland is an ostensible feminist utopia in which all Kens are subservient to all Barbies.
In the Wall Street Journal, former NATIONaL REvIEW critic Kyle Smith wrote that, ""As bubbly as the film appears, its script is like a grumpier-than-average women's studies seminar."" Upon leaving the movie, Ben Shapiro of the Daily Wire tweeted that ""all you need to know"" about it is that ""it unironically uses the word 'patriarchy more than 10 times."" With some time to collect his thoughts, Shapiro then took to YouTube with a video titled: ""Ben Shapiro DESTROYS The Barbie Movie For 43 Minutes."" And the Critical Drinker, a right-leaning and perspicacious YouTube film critic, savaged Barbie, calling it ""the greatest lie ever told.""

>Before rebutting the substance of these cases, it's important to describe some of the technical, non-thematic things Barbie excels at. In the hands of writer-director Greta Gerwig (with her husband Noah Baumbach co-writing), Barbie has an utterly consistent and relentless aesthetic vision. All that pink paint (so much that it may have affected the global supply) went to good use in creating Barbieland. It is a remarkably silly place, where houses have no walls, water isn't real, and characters fake eating, drinking, surfing, doctoring, and other activities. It's so silly that I found it overwhelming, even revolting, initially. But eventually it won me over.

>At the center of Barbieland is Robbie's Stereotypical Barbie. The notion of portraying a live-action doll is not wholly without precedent in film history, but it is fairly absurd. Yet Robbie sells it totally. Even better is Gosling's Ken. His commitment to this earnest, goofy, desperate, and vain character is scene-stealing, and might have stolen the movie itself were it not up to something more complex than it appears.

>If Barbie were simply the feminist screed some of its critics are taking it for, it would be a failure - an interesting, pretty failure, to be sure, but a failure all the same. >!If this assessment were correct, then the fact that Ken, upon returning to Barbieland, makes it into a patriarchy to which all of its Barbies instantly submit would represent an inadvertently more compelling and potent satire than the vision Barbie appears to offer in its stead. A kind of shallow Yas-Queening comes to reign again in Barbieland by the movie's conclusion, with the Kens only *slightly* better off, and the Barbies still in charge after Robbie's Barbie, with the help of some real-life humans, breaks their patriarchal false consciousness.!<

>But this interpretation fails to account for so much that it is surely mistaken. For one, the real world is not represented as quite the patriarchy Ken, with his superficial Barbieland brain, makes it out to be. After an initial montage (mantage?) that marks his realization of the patriarchy, Ken is rebuffed in all of his attempts to join the male hierarchy that purportedly dominates the world. He must return to Barbieland to institute it; what he institutes there is so shallow that it collapses almost as quickly as it is set up. Meanwhile, though Robbie's Barbie restores female dominance in Barbieland, she chooses not to stay there, electing instead to become fully human. What it all appears to suggest is that Barbieland is not merely a superficial construct but an entirely satirical one: a kind of post-feminist satire of what feminists imagine a perfect world looking like and of what they imagine male dominance is like. Plato had a city in speech; Gerwig has given us a city in plastic.

>The scenes in reality, and involving humans, are of much greater import than those set in Barbieland. It is two humans, mother Gloria (America Ferrera) and daughter Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt), who anchor the film. This is familiar territory for Gerwig, whose Ladybird has a similarly complicated mother-daughter relationship. It is Gloria's revelation of, and reveling in, the complications of real life that help to bring her daughter away from the crass cynicism in which she had been mired. And it is this embrace of reality, in all of its complications, transcending facile theorizing, that the film endorses. One sees this in Gloria's late-movie monologue, and in the realization by Mattel's corporate board that a ""reality Barbie"" would sell like hotcakes. It is especially evident in Stereotypical Barbie's decision to become human (a clever bookend to the 2001: A Space Odyssey reference that opens the film), with all its concomitant messiness.


>This is a bold claim. And one not without problems of its own. One male human character in our world might seem to counter the idea that Barbie means to complicate our appraisal of reality with his assertion that a patriarchy still exists, but we've just gotten better at hiding it. It also requires accepting entire portions of the movie - Helen Mirren's arch narration, almost everything that happens in Barbieland - as satirical. And it places upon the slender, plastic shoulders of a toy doll many layers of irony and complexity, perhaps more than they can reasonably bear. But detractors have a harder case to make. They must ignore, among other things, what happens to Robbie's Barbie and what the human world actually looks like. And perhaps most daunting, they must ignore the past work of Gerwig, who showed in Ladybird especially that she is far from some kind of straightforwardly vanguard feminist figure.


>I had to overcome my own hesitation to arrive at this view. Masculine pride makes it far easier for me to recommend Oppenheimer than to esoterically interpret Barbie positively. It is, to be clear, not really a movie about men. But it does not hate them. It is something far different, and far more interesting, than that.

879,"
Am I the only one who was so disappointed with the Barbie movie??? It just came across so preachy and just TOO on the nose. Overall it felt like they had so many ideas and wanted to shove so many messages and themes all in one movie and absolutely none landed a strong impact. 

Like I don‚Äôt even get what the overall message was of the film because it was just too rushed, the plot was so chaotic and nonsensical. Overall watching it, it just felt like I was watching the rough draft. Literally every scene they just HAD to spell out what misogynistic, patriarchal, unjust thing happened and then FURTHER DISSECT THROUGH DIALOGUE. To me that‚Äôs when you admit you have a shitty film if you have to spoon feed every message to the viewer. 

Like can they not trust us to understand through their acting what the message is??? I would have loved if they told a simple story about a mother and daughter troubled with injustice and adversity and having Barbie reflect this through her slow and SUBTLE transformation and keep the BULK of the story with Barbie navigating the real world instead of this random back in forth between the worlds??? The mother and daughter literally just felt like a random accessory to the film when they should have been the focal point. And then make Mattel such a huge part of the film when their purpose is so unimportant?? Also just unfunny. I love Will but didn‚Äôt laugh at a single joke he said because again it was just TOO FORCED. And then bringing the actual CEO for the tearjerker at the end, but how can I cry when I don‚Äôt even know wtf I‚Äôm crying for? ‚ÄúMothers stand still to see their daughters grow‚Äù um did we even get to fucking see that? Then the cliche ass montage of old times family videos of daughter running and old women smiling while a cringey Billie Eilish wannabe sings in the background. Did not do a damn thing for me. 

Just too many subplots, characters, messages shoved into a short ass film. It just lacked any depth or impact. It‚Äôs about QUALITY, not quantity. By trying to list out ‚Äúevery‚Äù issue a woman goes through in a random speech in the movie from a character that should have felt important but wasn‚Äôt because you didn‚Äôt take the time to give her any sort of backstory other than a measly flashback felt just so lazy and just not good. 

I‚Äôm sorry I was so excited for this film and it did have many great qualities and did mean well but in my humble opinion fell SO SHORT. It‚Äôs becoming a theme with a lot of movies. They underestimate the impact a simple story told WELL can have rather than trying to save the fucking world and bring peace between the genders through an hour and a half Barbie movie.",2023-07-26 08:44:57,17,movies,basicbitchfries,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

881,"Barbie Movie Thought Dump

The Kens need Feminism  
  
There's an obvious feminism discussion going on through the film. A main plot point is Barbie going to the real world and facing the ""patriarchy"", which is name dropped as a major plot force throughout the movie. To understand how it is used though, you have to first look at Barbie land.  
  
Barbie land is a magical place where a plaster pink idea of women supremacy reigns supreeme (note, not feminism, but supremacy). The Kens exist as eye candy with no real purpose and the Barbies go through a laundry list of these ideals, like a balance of emotion and rational thought and reaching and achieving any goal they set their mind to. While played as a joke, if clipped that scene could be used in a dystopian wonderland. Then generic Barbie has intrusive thoughts of death and cellulite and her fantasy is broken.  
  
In the real world, Barbie is forced to acknowledge that her work in Barbie land has not mirrored the real world. Here, women are not in charge and have little to no power; a point shown through her objectification (a man slapping her ass in public) and a Mattel board consisting of only men.   
  
When Barbie returns to Barbie land only to find Ken has brought the Patriarcy back home and brainwashed the other Barbies, she is devastated as she wants to go back to being perfect. Perfect being: flawless hair, no thoughts of death and no celulite, a very superficial definition.  
  
After experiencing the poor treatment women face in the real world and being forced to aknowlage this similar treatment to the Kens in her world, Barbie rembers the Matrix decision of choosing between heels or flats. The way things were, or the way things are. Here, the Kens are a metaphor for feminism: a fight for gender equality.   
  
Ken's journey is meant to mimic the suffrage movement. For women to get the right to vote, they had to rely on men to pass laws to give them rights. There is a level of irony to that statement. And this right didn't fix everything, it was merely a step in the right general direction.   
  
At the end of the movie, the Kens don‚Äôt get a supreme court seat or any position of real power and the marrarator notes, ‚Äúthe Kens have to start somewhere.‚Äù The outrage this situation causes some audience members (as dense as some may be) does put a light on some of the progress equal rights movements have made in gender equality. The Kens should have more positions of power and better representation. In the real world, the same goes for women.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Ken is an Incel  
  
In the last year I‚Äôve noticed multiple shows and movies (particularly comedic ones) tackling the topic of incels. More often than not, the incel is shown as a sterotypically attractive male in his mother‚Äôs basement doing nothing but objectifying women and complaining that life isn‚Äôt fair. This portrayal is stupid as it paints a one dimentional boogie man that no one can relate to, so no one will ever see themselves in the character, be willing to critique themselves, or promote meaningful change.   
  
The Barbie movie tackles this topic with a slam dunk by creating a character who is somewhat sympathetic while still being very much in the wrong. Ken is quite literally created to be Barbie's boyfriend. Barbie and Ken. The twist, Generic Barbie isn't interested in Ken. She never has been. Ken has a crisis because his whole purpose is to be Barbie's boyfriend and he can't fulfill this role. The narrator emphasizes this by saying, ""Barbie always has a perfect day. Ken only had a good day when Barbie looked at him.""  
  
There‚Äôs a feminist parrallel here, and a storyline where Barbie goes through a similar journey of self discovery, but it‚Äôs cool to see this topic tackled from the male perspective. In western culture, there‚Äôs a strong emphasis on a man‚Äôs worth being based on his capability to have a partner. Ken is not excluded from this expectation.   
  
Ken is a conventionally attractive, ripped, himbo who is doing everything in his power to get his girlfriend‚Äôs attention and getting little to none of it. He‚Äôs kicked out every night so Barbie can have girls night. He isn‚Äôt included in the big choreo number, only jumping in when a different Ken taunts him for having a part. He‚Äôs upset and defeated, so when he goes to the real world and sees the roles flip, he jumps at the opportunity for power. He wants some control and sense of purpose.   
  
In practice, even with all the power and control, Ken still can‚Äôt force Barbie to like him and doesn‚Äôt get the one thing he thought he wanted. When Barbie tells him to find what makes Ken, Ken, he begins with the very simple statement of, ‚ÄúKen is me‚Äù. Later, he is seen wearing a sweater that syas Kenough.   
  
There‚Äôs not a ton of payoff to this story line, but it‚Äôs not the plot of the movie, merely a consequence of having characters other than Barbie with hopes and ambition. A consequence of good writing. If there ever was a sequel delving into Ken‚Äôs character, there would be a deep well to pull from and I suspect horses would be involved.   
  
The interesting point is that this light incel characterization of Ken is defeated as Ken is forced to find purpose outside of romance. He needs to find joy in himself, by himslef. He needs to be Ken. Not some gender flipped other as ‚ÄúBarbie‚Äôs Boyfriend‚Äù.   
  
  
  
What is ""Barbie""  
  
In the Barbie movie, ‚ÄúBarbie '' is an abstract concept. The beginning of the movie pushes a strong corporate message thart Barbie allows girls to see themselves in any role, so all their problems are solved! Then the movie immediately dismantles this idea because, of course, it‚Äôs fictitious bs.   
  
Throughout the movie, Generic Barbie is forced to experience a more human existence and begins critiquing herself. She doesn't feel beautiful. She's not as smart as the other, more skilled Barbies. She doesn't doesn't know what her purpose is.  
  
This idea is also reflected in Ken. Ken has to learn to be his own person and find purpose outside of having a woman. He‚Äôs not doctor Ken, he‚Äôs not astronaut Ken, he‚Äôs not beach Ken. He is Ken and that is Kenough.  
  
These points are cemented in America Ferra‚Äôs monolouge discussing the complex and contradicting requirements of being a woman. It‚Äôs an excellent monolouge I encourage everyone to read because, at its roots, it discusses the struggles of being human. Never feeling good enough. Never knowing what you‚Äôre meant to do. Constantly comparing yourself to others. The movie is asking you to become the person you want to be. Find your interests and your desires and wear them unapologetically. At the same time, without having to directly say it, it‚Äôs asking you to respect other‚Äôs hopes and dreams so that they can do the same to you.  
  
At the end of the movie - in the limbo, white wall, projector realm - Barbie states that she doesn't want to be an idea - something that was created - but the thing that creates them. Humans. Barbie, as a concept, helps inspire others, but at the end of the day that is all an idea can do. An idea is at the whim of the actions of those who create. It is influenced and changed by them and has no control over itself. An idea itself cannot create. When Barbie choses to become human, she choses to make her own decisions and pave her own path despite the difficulties that come with being in charge of making your own decisions.",2023-07-25 15:03:42,17,movies,ribs0013,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

883,"I felt the movie low key blames women for the patriarchy. The Barbies allowed the Ken‚Äôs to establish a patriarchy out of nowhere. When they wanted to end it, they worked together to end it. If patriarchy exists, it‚Äôs because women allow it and it‚Äôs their job to stop it if they don‚Äôt like it. 

None of the Barbie‚Äôs are mothers. No shit they have careers and interesting lives. Maybe, just maybe, a woman‚Äôs role in bringing children into the world and getting them on their feet sets her back a few steps and cumulatively over generations the patriarchy gains hold.",2023-12-28 08:19:08,17,movies,jendet010,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

I came in expecting some movie about barbie escaping into the real world, getting sentience and forming a global scale rebellion or something.

889,"I really loved Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie in this movie.  Those two absolutely stole the show in my opinion they just played their roles amazingly.  I actually think that Barbie felt a little underdeveloped for where she ended up as.  I just really didnt like the mom and daughter.  The daughter's first line made me eyeroll and the mom had some sweet moments, but her saving by talkinh about the ""real world"" and the whole patriarchy plot felt bleh.  I don't hate these ideas at all and in a barbie movie could be explored really thouroughly, but it just felt forced and too on the nose to where it felt kind of pretensious.  You could automatically read where the mom and daughter were gonna end up the moment you meet them and they just seemed so predictable and don't capitalize in their moments to make me feel for them by seeming pretensious.  There's no subtlety at all and it hurts because Barbies development is tied to them.  Barbie was actually amazing in this.  The scene where she was sitting on the bench, when she was in the kitchen, and her final couple scence were amazing, but it got sidelined for a dumb plot.

Despite being harsh, again Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are amazing actors.  The set design is dropdesd gorgeous and genius.  It was actually pretty funny at moments, and the concept is cool.  Also I feel like Allen shouldve bonded with that one desk guy.  Like idk what was the point of Allen in the end.  He was really just there for no reason, and the idea that he could represent the struggling class of people was RIGHT there.",2023-07-23 06:06:22,17,movies,cuhman1cuhman2,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

891,"As a filmmaker and a queer pastel princess, I was so so so excited for this film. Campy movies with bright colors, outlandish designs, and dark humor are always my favorite. I was ready for the darkly funny Stepford Wife/Pleasantville vibes that the trailer gave and went in full pink regalia with my friends. 

  
**Pros:** It was really funny in a campy way, had an important message, and the set + costume design was amazing. I want every single outfit and every piece of furniture in my home. Ken being an insecure incel had me rolling the entire time. America Ferrera's speech also destroyed my heart. There were also a lot of really beautiful moments like Barbie soaking in her surroundings that I wanted to see more of. 

   
**Cons:** It felt like everything was just rushed through, which made the message and the character arcs feel really surface-level. I wish they took more time to build up to Barbie's realization. For ex: Instead of things changing basically overnight, having weird things build up little by little to a point where she can't ignore it anymore. I  also 100% agree with the feminist message, but I wish it was executed in a way that wasn't so spelled out. I think showing the contrast between Barbieland and America Ferrera's experiences in the real world would've been more impactful. Or if they showed more of Barbie struggling to navigate the real world while Ken slowly discovered more about the patriarchy. IMO, it would've been better as a two-part movie. I feel like only Ken got a real character arc and the room to shine as a character.

While I did think the script was funny, I also don't think the writers knew the type of humor they were going for. It seemed like they wanted to do a satire/dark comedy, but didn't know how to approach serious topics like gender inequality and womens struggles without being on-the-nose. Tbh I wish it was written the way Addams Family Values was. It was able to blend dark humor, campiness, and bitingly smart commentary about class and conservatism so well that you didn't even realize it until after.

In conclusion, is it the witty, deep satire that I thought it'd be? No. But I did have fun and will watch again next weekend in a ridiculous pink, fluffy tulle gown. This is my review that nobody asked for :')

894,"Warning: Many spoilers.

I really, really wanted to like this movie. I'm a big fan of Barbie and fashion dolls in general (I make OOAK dolls) and there's been so much hype in the doll community about this! But I spent most of it just... disappointed.

First, some positives. There's so much attention to detail in regards to set accuracy and Barbie history! The obnoxious neon rollerskates were so perfect. The fridge being filled with stickers was so funny. The way Barbie brushed her hair and teeth was a great visual gag. All the costumes and many props are based off real Barbie items, and some of them are very obscure. It was fun looking at all the eye candy. 

The Barbie and Ken lineups were beautifully diverse. Although people usually picture Barbies as blonde, nowadays there's a huge range of body types, heights, and skin colors, and it was great seeing that recognized.

And there were some genuinely funny moments. Alan's moment in the spotlight, the nods to discontinued dolls, and the entire concept of Weird Barbie were great.

Also, wow, a lot of the actors were giving 100% and it shows. 

However, pretty much everything I liked were related to sets, costumes, and references -- mostly cosmetic. And I'm upset about that, because dangit, I really wanted to like this.

So... The movie sets up the Barbie world as very unrealistic, overly idealized, and silly (as it should be), but the real world is equally silly. There needed to be a strong contrast between the idealistic, perpetually perfect world of Barbie and the ""real world."" But there isn't. (Aside from colors, they did a great job on that.) The Mattel employees are like a parody (tickle fights??), but... the Barbie world itself is already a parody. 

The ""real people"" don't really have any logical character growth or motivations. The teenaged daughter hates her mom, so her mom is thinking about death? Why? And how does it get resolved? We never see them even talk it out. It's just... suddenly fixed at the end. 

And now, the big message. This is meant to be a feminist movie. The thing is, feminism is... not about women being above men and taking over everything. Yes, the patriarchy is real and a problem, but the problem is simply reversed in Barbieland -- and even in that idealistic world, they can't find a solution that involves equality. Heck, Ken is supposed to be funny for feeling dissatisfied that he doesn't have a house, he's not allowed to have any career, or that his own girlfriend treats him like an inconvenience. Those are big issues! And it makes sense he feels unhappy! But none of these issues are solved at the end. The Barbies just celebrate that they took back the power, and the Kens have basically nothing again.

Speaking of Ken, he just... wasn't likeable. Ryan Gosling was giving it his all, but the character just went from pathetic to obnoxious and back to pathetic. (His musical number was great, though.) Honestly, Pixar handled Ken's character better in Toy Story 3. He should be Barbie's unwaveringly dedicated supporter, satisfied to do nothing but adore his beautiful girlfriend. (And she should... actually like him? She doesn't seem to in this movie.) 

I think they could have handled the Barbie world in a funny, satirical way, while still respecting (and developing) the established canon that people enjoy. And I think they could have also made powerful commentary on lack of equality in the real world, while still having a Barbie-centered plot. Unfortunately, this movie didn't accomplish either. And I'm sad about it.",2023-07-22 13:54:16,17,movies,incrediblestrawberry,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
895,"I was looking forward to another well written movie with feminist themes from Greta but the writing of the scenes that talk about feminism and the patriarchy was so bad and basic that I didn‚Äôt really feel anything most of the time while watching them. Also I feel like they could have added more magical elements to barbieland, I mean there‚Äôs plenty of dolls and play sets from the animated movies that would have looked so beautiful in live action.",2023-07-24 00:28:40,17,movies,,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
896,"To those who didn't get any aha! or haha!
moments, well, this movie wasn't made for you. Not every film is for everyone.

I've always been pretty much in the middle between a tomboy and a girly-girl. I wasn't allowed to have a Barbie growing up (my dad was certain it would make me vain and materialistic), but I played with them at friends' houses. Still, I wear makeup and like to dress nicely, but the only pink thing I own is a gifted pair of dangly earrings.

My best friend was in town on opening day of the Barbie movie. We figured it would be light, silly, girl-centric fun, and thought, Sure, why not? We located maybe the last two tickets in the county, as every other theater was sold out for every showing.

Well. We. Loved. It. We played the Spotify soundtrack all afternoon. We quoted lines from the movie all week. I took another friend on her first social outing post surgery. Then my elderly mom wanted to go, so I took her. And another friend wanted to see it with me, so I've ""accidentally"" seen it 4 times. Each time, I notice more details. And still love it.

It's funny, uplifting, pokes fun at outdated traditions, sparks memories of childhood play and innocence, and scorches the impossible task of being a perfect woman, with truth and humor. 

A few of the tropes seemed forced or gratuitous, such as gagging at Barbie's flat feet, the ""White Savior Barbie"" comment, and Ferrell's character inexplicably mentioning Jewish friends and referring to himself as a mother -- twice!, but these record-scratch moments were thankfully brief and few. The eye-candy visuals, well-placed music, and the message that women are much more than their looks, by far outweigh the negatives, in my opinion. Ryan Gosling looked like he had a blast in this role, and Margo Robbie as Barbie could not have been better cast. It is a sentimental romp, with teeth, and it clearly resonated with millions.",2023-09-06 21:43:19,17,movies,MindTraveler48,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

I feel like the ideas were made to appeal to older people satirizing Barbie rather than solely appealing to children. Also, a decent amount of the jokes, messages, innuendos, etc. would not be comprehensible to kids. Am I missing something or is it intended for adults?

Barbie returns to keep the status quo, Ken returns to change it. Barbie then has a emotional meltdown and other women/barbies have to take over in the final act of the movie. Ken even gets the big fight/musical number scene. The only moment in the movie Barbie shows any agency over her own destiny is when she chooses not to go back into the box and runs away from Mattel, but that doesn't change the course of the movie either because she still ends up back in barbieland all the same. idk, I was ready for the biggest girl power movie in 2023 but this felt so unsatisfying.",2023-07-22 19:04:39,17,movies,DevilsOfLoudun,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

908,"I am so much disappointed with the ending of that movie. It had a good promise but last 20 minutes ruined everything.  


I believed that Ken patriarchy was a parody of all sigma male / andrew tate fans mindset. It seemed logical to show that when Barbies do not care about Kens then the Kens rebel and express ultra-male behaviors like that sigma male bs. When Kens gave up on patriarchy I hoped the movie would end with conclusion that Ken doesn't need to be overly masculine to be seen worthy and Barbie doesn't need to be perfect to be a Barbie but instead it showed that Kens after ending patriarchy again became trash and 2nd class citizens while Barbies have all the control. And Margot Robbie Barbie would not love or care about Ken Ryan Gosling  no matter how hard he tries.  


""Now Ken has as much power as woman in real world"" - what the hell is that even supposed to mean. The movie seemed like a suggestion to end gender war and gender stereotypes but instead added more gasoline to the fire.  I don't know what world director had in mind but I live in country where both genders could vote since country was created in 1918. Country that was a soviet satelite where everyone was equal to law. Where woman and man were both viewed as equal workers. I work in a place where boss is woman. In the office I am surrounded by women and they earn as much as me or even more. They are free to take days off anytime their kids feel sick and I have to stay late and meet the deadlines when workforce is reduced. Since I'm male I am also expected by the law to carry heavier packages and fight in the wars.   


And don't talk about men being 99% of CEOs. Without having rich connections me  (young male) and you (young female) both have 0% chances of becoming CEO of big company. It's not war men vs women, it should be war poor vs rich and powerful.  


Since Kens were rulers only during Ken Patriarchy and returned to being 2nd class citizens after ending their male kingdom then this film suggests that if men want to be respected and rule in their households they need to be sigma assholes. Good job, movie suggests making things even worse.

923,"I can't believe I'm about to say this earnestly, but Barbie is a real W for Warner Bros. Discovery, toy-to-film adaptations, and Michael Cera.

This is what has been missing from cinemas: you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll have a great time. This is how satire is supposed to be done; reenact a complex idea using simple characters. To me, this film challenged gender roles using hyperfeminine/masculine dolls.

But that's just an episode of television. The thing that really elevated this film was bringing characters in and out of the real world. This type of fourth-wall break is usually excessive and blunt. But I think it served as a good barometer of what we think the world is like VS what it is actually like.

Usually not a fan of Greta Gerwig, but I have to give her props with Barbie. She nailed it 10/10!",2023-07-21 03:54:27,16,movies,DavyJonesRocker,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

927,"Gosling stealing the show feels almost antithetical to the premise, but the clincher for me is the ending. Why would Barbie decide to live in the real world after seeing the reality of the patriarchy? Wanting to create rather than be the product kinda subverts the plot.

931,"No one's gonna read my comment, but oh well!  

I've learned that Gerwig simply does not do subtlety, and that worked pretty well for Barbie's over-the-top world and story. I really liked this movie. The *overt* feminism and the reversal of making Ken sympathetic in the face of a matriarchy equally as unfair as our real-world patriarchy was an interesting spin. And ""I'm Just Ken"" was such a ride! I thought it was great how soft the Kens' masculinity was, holding hands and being emotionally supportive of each other-- So sweet! And Allan representing the real-life men who support equality and don't subscribe to toxic masculinity was a nice touch.

I liked the bittersweet ending with Kens being limited to aspiring to the power that real-world women hold (ouch). But I'd have liked for the main Ken to have had just a bit more of a wrap-up like Barbie got. (Congrats on the genitals, girl!)  

Another minor complaint I had is that Gerwig has a way of rushing and ham-fisting mother-daughter relationships, which was my main issue with Ladybird, too. As authentic as the relationship is meant to feel (especially since Gerwig has stated that Ladybird was inspired by her own experiences), it just lacks nuance. The cliche rift of angsty teen girl vs her mom. Somehow even in Ladybird, it felt too bland, and there was even less meat on those bones in Barbie. I found myself not being drawn into the tension between the mother and daughter in Barbie at all. It was fine as a B plot I guess and tied into the positive feminine representation. Meh. The dolls ironically felt much more real, their struggles and personalities more compelling, and their conclusions more satisfying.  

Mattel being so cartoonish *kinda* worked, but I thought it dampened the contrast between the supposedly harsh ""real"" world and Barbie's plastic dreamland. I guess it's fine if the intended audience is little kids, but I think it would've benefited from the real world holding more weight, kind of like Disney's Enchanted. But I guess that's really not what they were going for here.  

Anyway, Barbie was fun! It made me laugh several times, and it hit some solid emotional beats. I'm definitely gonna watch it again.",2023-07-26 06:46:27,16,movies,planet_vagabond,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
932,"Thought the movie was great. Good comedy and a self aware film I wasn‚Äôt expecting from something with the Barbie name. As a male I thought the America Ferrera was impactful and well put. Listening to it, in my head, there were some moments I believe both genders have experienced but as she kept going there were things that I had never even considered or crossed my mind. Also seeing it with the gf I thought the mansplaining portion was hilarious because I‚Äôve definitely done the whole *Godfather* and trying to explain the stock market and investments to her.

934,"I went to see the Barbie movie last night and really enjoyed it. Many complex ideas and feelings were portrayed in such a clever way. Cried a couple of times, obviously the heavily emotional parts like Barbie/Ruth scene or the scene at the bus stop when Barbie starts to soak in the human experience by watching people argue, laugh, and then turns to the old lady.

But also when I saw some of the emotions I‚Äôve experienced being portrayed and described to a whole audience. I felt validated. It was almost like a hug. So many things about being a woman can‚Äôt be said or explained because people don‚Äôt believe you, or think you‚Äôre being emotional or you‚Äôre blowing it out of proportion. Like when they arrive at the real world and how Barbie feels self conscious, how she gets assaulted, the comments the police officers say about her, etc. 

Another good one, for instance at work, if you‚Äôre dismissed and have  tried to talk to people about a certain issue, and people just go ‚Äúhave you tried talking to the higher ups? I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll listen‚Äù. As a woman, yes you try but hardly ever gets to anywhere.  They kinda show this in how Gloria tries to stop the dude from going in the meeting. She knows the rules and is expected to follow them. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt go in, they are in creative meeting‚Äù then the dude just walks in. Yes, they make fun of him and try to dismiss him. But is still given a chance to talk, made me wonder how many times Gloria was even called out for only knocking the door. 

Anyways, I could go on, but this morning I realized that a lot of my coworkers went to see it last night too, and i am really not looking forward to have a conversation about this movie with them.",2023-08-02 13:16:22,16,movies,fallen_fruit,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

A few aspects felt a little half baked or like they got edited out (a lot of the Will Farrel/Cubicle Guy/Mattel stuff), but this is a very good movie that I can see appealing to most anyone. It‚Äôs a type of movie that feels geared towards both kids and adults (like most classics - Jurassic Park, Back to the Future, etc) that has often gone away.   


Its not as funny as some movies and it‚Äôs not quite as good of an exploration on feminism / the lives of women as something like Gerwig‚Äôs Little Women, but that‚Äôs kind of what you get when youre balancing both.

I feel like I was too tired and emotionally not in the right headspace to really get into the Barbiesphere.

I'm seeing it again next weekend with my sister, just Barbie by itself. I think I'll really enjoy the experience a lot more. Robbie and especially Gosling's acting was superb, and I think the pacing will seem a little more even and the jokes will land a little better.

946,"Hello Internet! I've come to provide my thoughts to the dicussion because that's what Reddit is, a place where everyone deserves to see and hear all our thoughts on everything. Yay!  


First, I have to say, on opening night this was hands down on of the best theater experiences I've ever had. Everyone was dressed in pink or outlandishly in Barbie themed costume, everyone showed up on time and went to the bathroom prior to the movie beginning, there was no whispered conversations about nonsense or bright glows of cell phones, I didn't even hear a cough or see anyone go down the stairs to leave for a break during the movie, in fact nearly everyone stayed through the credits. We truly joined in on the laughter, the emotions and the music together; and it was that ""the movies were meant to be seen"" shit that actors/directors keep thanking us for.   


Second, I'd like to begin with my questions. How many flippin' types of Barbies are there?! Also, is Margot Robbie the combination of all Stereotypical Barbies, or just one Stereotypical Barbie in a singular Barbieland of potentially infinite Barbielands? What type of Barbie was Kate McKinnon's ""Weird Barbie"" prior to the Weirdening? I did have a criticism on the Mattel board, featuring Will Ferrell's CEO. I'm not really sure what their point was, and if they were meant to serve as anything more than filler. It seems, to me at least, that there was a lot more written and intended there, but given that Mattel was involved it got edited out. In fact, a lot of the consumerism got underplayed, which was an interesting choice. It just seemed like an underutilization of what could've been a fun exploration or plot line.  


Third ...   
Barbieland is just as messed up as Century City. Barbieland is not intended to be written as some sort of utopian dream land we should all aspire to. It's shown as a land of a child's imagination, where there are no complexities and the world just works because it does. While there are probably dozens of Barbies and Kens in Barbieland; I believe there's only one actual Barbie and one Ken. It's not a whole world of women running every corner of government and economy, but one girl believing she can do any job in her world of play and do any career that Mattel sells a costume for. It isn't a sea of Kens just feeling useless on the beach, it's just one doll waiting until that girl is ready to play the happily ever after scene.

I don't think Ken ever understood the patriarchy, I think he just saw a world where Kens had stories of their own. However, he could never execute this because he still needed to be given his story, failing to realize that Barbies are also most likely not free-thinkers (relying on the owner at play), so he filled that void with masculine consumerism, machoism and an attempted coup. Wait, there's a hole in the logic: ""If they're not free-thinkers, how are they able to cross-over and go on this adventure?"" I don't know, it's a freakin' movie, also I feel it's more of a compulsion than decisions, as she just follows where the vision tells her and then other players engage in the decision making going forward really, while she's in crisis mode constantly, until fed inspiration.

I don't know what this Barbie Constitution looks like, I hope one day Nick Cage will steal it for us all to see. However, a government and society that makes an entire group of people a second class, subject to life long servitude, is not a government we should really support (\*ahem\*). I think what a lot of the folks in this thread here don't realize, is that's the whole point. I think maybe a lot of folks only are getting upset about it now because they are seeing themselves in the characters being subjected to the mistreatment; which goes to show how surprisingly effective this movie is. It's not idolizing the Barbie government, it is quite literally saying ""hey, let's stop trying to politicize and govern genders specifically and separately ... also maybe let's try including more people into the fold."" I think the point of Issa Rae's President saying no to a Supreme Court position, but yes to a lower court position, is one: in part to my many barbies, one girl theory and two: and example of how slow moving human society is to progress and no one has been allowed to jump bars that quickly, regardless of when people suddenly take notice of them.  


Third and a Half ...  
I might be a stupid piece of plastic, but those are my simple thoughts leaving the movie theater about a movie that stars Kate McKinnon doing the splits: we don't need to take it as seriously as Far East Foreign Trade Policy if you disagree.   


Fourth ...

I thought it was worth pointing out because I see it as progress that might have gone unnoticed. Ryan Gosling's Ken flirts with Doctor Barbie in this movie, who is played by openly Trans actress Hari Nef. Doctor Barbie isn't ""Trans Doctor Barbie"", there isn't a 20 minute segment about her being Trans, in fact there's no mention of it at all; she is simply a Barbie that's a doctor. I find it very refreshing that stories are hiring LGBTQIA+ folks and not needing to center the reason around their being LGBTQIA+, their characters can just participate in life and society, without being tokenized or traumatized.",2023-07-23 01:17:20,16,movies,stepfordhusbandken,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
947,"So what I‚Äôm taking away politically from this movie is that the best way to crush a revolution is to turn the revolutionaries against each other then once they‚Äôve been defeated offer them meaningless concessions to keep them happy.

EVERY scene with Margot and Ryan was amazing, I wished we had even more of those. There were a few subplots that I didn't particularly care for. The daughter + America part felt underwhelming.

Also while I do get the female empowerment message of the movie, I think it was a little too on the nose done at certain points via just flat out saying it. Showcasing it through scenes / events would've been better IMO. A case of ''show don't tell''.

First half kept the film fun while conveying some deeper concepts. Then you see the barbie's become brainwashed to forget their lives & worship patriarchy. The executive board plays no meaningful contribution to the plot. 

The overall message of the film was beaten to death by the end. Clearly conveyed before 15 minutes of Ken having an existential crisis & Barbie's conversation with Ruth. 

Not sure why the film pushed for that PG-13 rating either by adding only a couple explicit lines. Still a fun movie with a good message, just it missed the marker numerous times.",2023-07-22 00:17:29,16,movies,Fennlt,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
959,"I looked forward to Barbie, but it did not live up to the hype. Watching it once was ok. I would not watch it twice.  


The good:

* Funny jokes and ideas
* Set design
* Acting was good, especially Ryan Gosling. Where the acting lacked seemed the fault of the writer.
* It was cool that Mattel approved such a self-deprecating movie

The bad:

* The flow of the story
* The character development
* The message and emotions seemedforced

This movie had great skin but no bones. It had great jokes, great acting, and a pretty good but cheesy song. But the story was not compelling and felt forced. I never felt connected to any characters. 

The scene where Barbie and Ken enter the human world is clunky. Their realizations about the human world were fast and not believable. The movie Life Size depicted Eve's introduction to the human world with more grace. The first time Eve discovers real food, her reaction is hysterical, and you believe her. She is reacting to the world in only the way she knows. To be fair, I last watched Life Size when I was probably 9, so I am likely misremembering. 

But, when Barbie and Ken enter the Human world, they encounter very cliche events, and their reactions and realization are too immediate. I did love the joke where Barbie thought the bathing suit lineup was the supreme court. But then Barbie immediately gets catcalled by construction workers and responds like a feminist professor pointing out they had an undertone of violence. The situation was cliche, and it didn't make sense for Barbie's character to instantly assess a situation she had never been in. It seemed very forced and obvious, like it belonged in an improv scene.

In one scene, Barbie breaks down, crying that she isn't pretty or smart enough. America Ferrera gives her a pep talk about how hard it is to be a woman. This scene felt so out of place. Barbie's breakdown seemed unexpected. At no point in the movie did anyone expect her to be smarter or tell her she wasn't pretty. It was unclear where this breakdown came from. America's speech also seemed out of place. It felt like a substitute for conveying a message through the story itself. She talks about the complications of being a woman, but nowhere in the film do we see her or Barbie face those complications.

Similarly, the scene at the end where Barbie wants to be human seemed like the directors were trying to force the emotion.

I expected the movie to combine Legally Blonde's feel-good pink-filled feminist plot and Zoolander's quirky outlandish jokes. While the style of the movie was unique, the story itself did not come together nicely. It's disappointing because it could have been so good and unique with a more fleshed-out story.",2023-08-07 05:02:56,16,movies,dashbarkhuss,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
960,"Just saw it today and god I enjoyed it. Think the only weak point for me was that the Will Ferrell character could have been played by a nameless suit and present in less scenes.

I laughed at so many of the jokes and the cast was fantastic. Probably my favourite Gosling performance and just makes me wish for him to do more musicals (""I'm just Ken"" is absolutely iconic). I would honestly be shocked if they don't make a broadway show of this film, the entire premise fits the stage so well and they have a banger song already. Also was nice to see Simu Liu in this, if they made Zoolander now he'd definitely have a role in it I think.",2023-09-13 22:00:07,16,movies,Pway,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

To a kid, it must be confusing and seem very random. To an adult, it‚Äôs condescending. It needed to commit one way or the other. 

Also, the plot was very disjointed. This would have worked better as the long journey to find the kid that owned Margot Robbie.

The movie explores a lot of allegories and social commentaries, but it should‚Äôve fleshed out the plot more.  The mom‚Äôs big speech just came out of nowhere without a big emotional impact.  The Barbies‚Äô plot to regain control left me asking, is that it?  

I would‚Äôve loved to see more fish out of water scenes with Barbie and Ken in the real world a la Enchanted.  They had that rollerblading scene in Santa Monica, and then that was it.",2023-07-23 03:23:49,15,movies,Itchy-University6628,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
968,"I think the barbie movie‚Äôs view on feminism is fair

I would go as far as to say it‚Äôs a more mediated approach to the discussion.

In the barbie world, the roles are reversed in terms of men and women, by the end of the movies the barbie said that the kens going to have to slowly gain authority which eventually would equal the barbies.

While the movie ends with the barbies ‚Äòwinning‚Äô, it is not anyone‚Äôs victory, just a shift view, and we know from speech that they will eventually be equals.

Back on the real real world side the roles are flipped, so the statement becomes that women will have to slowly earn authority and autonomy until it eventually equals that of men. 

the state of power in barbie land in the beginning and the end stays the exact same, but everyone agrees that kens would have been worse off if the event of the movie didn‚Äôt happen. 

 the event in the movie sparked a discussion that ultimately lead to both the kens and the barbies understanding each other and in turn themselves more.

Isn‚Äôt that what we should have in this grand discussion? Empathy?",2023-08-07 20:50:09,15,movies,BLUEAR0,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
969,"This is coming from a woman that has seen the Barbie movie. I'm not on board with a lot of the messaging but in this movie. Overall it feels like an appeasement and simplification, ultimately people are celebrating it as a winning message for women. Which is a shame because they aren't thing beyond what is on the screen.

Barbie has never been allowed to be a mother. Why is that? In my life I have a successful career and I am a mother, although the world can make it difficult at times, why are we...and why isn't Barbie allowed to have both? Mattel has never let Barbie be a mom yet it's  very real issue that women face in the modern day and age, where we are force to be one or the other. Why isn't there an astrophysicist Barbie with a kid?

Second the movie showed different kinds of women and Barbies. But in real life while Barbies on the toy store shelf come in different ethnicities and cultures sure, but they all look perfect with unrealistic bodies. None of them have realistic body shapes and sizes.
The movie does nothing to address the undue pressures of beauty standards and prefection that Barbie has placed upon women for decades now. 

There is a weird barbie in the movie ""because she was played with too hard"" she is barbie that doesn't look perfect with odd haircut ect. Reinforcing the idea that there is a normal way to look and a non perfect outward appearance is ""weird"".

All this to say it's a movie and it overly simplified a lot in terms of messaging. I don't think anyone should take took much away from it.",2023-08-02 14:52:02,15,movies,allegory_story,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

971,"It was decent, I kinda wish Ken(s) got a more satisfying resolution. 

And before you say ‚Äú it‚Äôs a Barbie movie, it‚Äôs about Barbie‚Äù I ask that you watch Wreck-it Ralph. A movie about old games, obviously geared towards a male audience and older, and it has a great resolution for the female side character Vanellope. She was a great character with problems, and her story was about feminism and how she didn‚Äôt fit the stereotype of cute girls into girl stuff. Her story didn‚Äôt take anything away from how good the whole movie was. This could have been Ken.

Movie was fairly funny, great acting and costumes/settings, and some interesting ideas but just didn‚Äôt end in a satisfying way and it was a little preachy. A 9/10 or 10/10 film to me is Everything, Everywhere All At Once and I wouldn‚Äôt say Barbie is anywhere close to that.",2023-07-26 05:26:14,15,movies,Aznmok,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
972,"Excerpts from my Letterboxd review:

In journeying to the real world, Barbie not only wrestles with objectification but learns to stop seeing herself through others' eyes as the object, finally standing on her own two (flat) feet.

Elsewhere, the concept of Ken as a stand-in for all the insecure men who treat women as mere extensions of their ego ‚Äî well, it's sublime. Indeed, this dress-up, toybox world is perfect for skewering the performative antics of self-styled ""alpha males"".

As absurd and cerebral as the film gets, Gerwig finds a wellspring of emotion in the nostalgia of childhood, specifically the idea of Barbie as the idealised adulthood children think they will grow into. The conflict between the pristine utopia of Barbie and the painful, this-is-water realities of adulthood forms the film's beating heart ‚Äî Margot Robbie captures the conflict with soul and gentle grace, at times calling to mind her angelic version of Sharon Tate.",2023-07-22 15:28:51,15,movies,MrAdamWarlock123,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

976,"I loved it. The Kens were almost in the exact same situation as the women in the real world, and vice versa. Except in the real world, there are actually three sitting women supreme court justices, lol. But overall it was pretty realistic. Also, everything is more plastic and fake in the Barbie world.

The tactics that they used to take the world back from the Kens was turning the Kens against each other over sexual competition, just like gender flipped a mirror of the real world.

The movie promotes racial harmony, with Sasha 'cancelling' Barbie in an early scene but in the end comes around to working together with her. It also suggests that the Kens' wars between men are less important than the gender wars. I'm not sure how realistic that is, but it does try to hit home that ""gender is the real struggle"".

I love how the message of this movie is, 'women are people', women are human and not Barbies. Barbies are just a two dimensional reflection of the real world. The reality is that groups with less power get to be ""less human"", since their humanity is suppressed or ignored. So Barbie choosing to become human in the end was the only possible ending that worked for this.",2023-07-30 22:28:27,15,movies,Electrical-Mission,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

Ryan Gosling was amazing. I didn't know he could be like that tbh haha. his character is hilarious, engaging and the one I enjoy the most.

Fast-paced, yet it doesn't feels rushed. Blood rushed throughout the movie by how vibrant and festive the atmosphere is. ngl, the dances, the songs and the dialogues are very enjoyable; which a surprise since I mostly cringe during dance scene.

Some characters might feel, meh. Like Will Farell could've a better character. but all in all doesn't bother me a bit.

981,"Finished the movie and I can say this is the most surprising movie of the year. Loved the movie. 

Greta really did a great job in balancing the emotional scenes as well as the comedic ones. I was surprised that there were some emotional scenes in the movie but hey not only were they there but they were well done. The scene at the bus stop where Barbie looks at the old woman was just beautiful. The jokes in addition were well written and the scenes were not just filled with stupid jokes like how we saw in Thor L&T.  Was great to see a movie with jokes and fun considering how all the recent movies were all action and stuff. 

The cast was perfect. Margot Robbie as barbie was a incredible choice (that 4th wall break about her was well done and smart), Ryan Gosling as Ken was just....perfect. He and Simu Lui killed their role.  Micheal Cera as Allan was great. He wasnt used too much, or too less but the perfect amount. 

The plot was well a bit thin but was well executed with good pacing, however the ending scene between barbie and the founder could be cut by a min or two. In contrast the ""Ken War"" has to be one of the best comedic musical scenes hollywood has come out with. That was just incredible to watch in the big screen. The set was just beautiful.  

Well done and executed on all levels, good pacing and great jokes. Good movie however I can see some people finding it bland or not good.

Why did America Ferrara just go vigilante when all her executive staff was chasing her? The toy to human connection is what? You get to Barbieland by roller blading in Venice Beach?

987,I watched Oppenheimer and Barbie today watched Barbie last but tbh I wish I watched it first. I watched allot of reviews and people say they were surprised by the movies story. But the second they get to the real world it just became so predictable. Patriarchy and consumerism are evil. I understand the message the director wanted to convey but it was done so poorly. The movie requires no critical thinking skills cause it holds your hand and then just mansplains the message to you. Maybe that was point the director was going for. Not to mention allot of the characters weren‚Äôt fleshed out the mom and daughter honestly could‚Äôve been written out of the movie without hurting any of the story elements. It was a really funny movie tho and the ending was beautifully done but the journey that got us there felt like a different movie. You can‚Äôt just shit on a gender for 65% of a movie then switch up and say you just need to love yourself and not revolve your life around me. Like no duh captain obvious.

988,"The Lego movie is my favorite animated movie of all time. I put it top 5 movie of all time for me as well. 


I love how that movie is so creative, so funny, so filled with subtle commentary and how goofy it can be. I know it's one giant commercial for toys and I know it's made by a mega corporation kind of making fun of themselves but I don't care because it's such a joy to watch. 


When I saw that a Barbie movie was coming out made by Greta gerwig I knew it would be a similar idea to that. I figured he would be full of social commentary and generally harp on society today. What I was expecting was something subtle, goofy and funny like the Lego movie. However, the Barbie movie is the opposite of subtle in any way. The middle monologue in this movie made by the mom legitimately felt like a collection of tweets I've seen. And it was recited like it was a stage play it was so bizarre. It was so bizarre how this movie just felt the need to spell out every single theme every single time. Which is weird because this is Greta Gerwig and both her previous movies did subtly so well. 


I am also disappointed at how unfunny this movie really is. Each joke felt like an SNL sketch and the majority of visual jokes just felt so on the nose. This movie relied a lot on randomness for humor that I don't really think worked. It just wasn't that fun to watch outside of the first scenes in Barbieland.


This movie just felt so all over the place in the worst way possible and could've used a lot more subtle in its messaging that's for sure.the plot just felt so lost and uninspiring.I'm very disappointed in Greta I thought she would do better.


A quick side note is the daughter character was just so poorly written. As soon as she started yelling at Barbie the first time I 100000% thought she was gonna call barbie a facist and sure enough she did.

Margot Robbie has a whole existential crisis about what it means to be a woman in the real world. America Ferrera is reconciling the romantic idea of what barbie meant to her childhood with the reality that other little girls faced when presented with a barbie. I thought there was going to be something of a mother/daughter story, but that never really fleshed out. 

I understood the themes pretty well but it was kinda unfair that so much was cut to make this film 2 hours. The result is okay but you can tell that there was more that wanted to be said and shown.",2023-08-01 21:41:05,15,movies,TheOnlySafeCult,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

996,"I really enjoyed the film, it was a colorful romp with a lot of visual intrigue and a solid bunch of actors and jokes. The film is very heavy-handed with the themes of matriarchy vs. patriarchy, but this is a Great Gerwig film, what did you expect? This is not a bland corporate ""please everyone"" film, and that's on purpose. 

Honestly, this feels like a vent film. The monologue toward the end about the duality of expectations for women resonated hard for me. It's nice to hear those sentiments out loud, some of them I had internalized without realizing it. In regards to Ken, I started out in the first scene thinking ""Man, Barbie should really be nicer to Ken,"" but in truth she was establishing a firm boundary with a man she didn't have feelings for. The fact that Ken went off the deep end because of that is *his* failure, not hers. Barbie has to go out of her way to defuse Ken's emotional burden at the end of the film, and even then he tries to re-route her kindness into a relationship, to the point of forcing a hug on her. Ken is the epitome of a Nice Guy, he won't take no for an answer and is explosive if he doesn't get his way (once he realizes that is an option.) Both Barbie and Ken deal with a lack of purpose, but it's Barbie who turns that into something constructive rather than destructive.

Also the soundtrack is a banger, several songs were written specifically for the movie and they are great tie-ins (the opening song, Dua Lipa's 'Dance the Night Away', Billie Eilish's 'What Was I Made For', Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice with ""Barbie Girl (With Aqua)"")

Edit: A fun fact, ""Magic Earring Ken"" is a real doll from the late 80s/early 90s. Designers wanted Ken to be ""modern and hip"", so they went to clubs to see what guys were wearing. Only problem was, they went to gay clubs. In the movie he wears a Ken necklace, but in the credits you can see his original design with a ""circle"" necklace. Let's just say it was a ring, but not for your finger... ;) The doll was quickly pulled, but is now a collector's item and mascot for the gay community",2023-07-23 08:19:41,15,movies,cinemachick,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

The movie had me smiling for its entirety while also hitting me with too relatable shit at time amd also simultaneously highlighting feminism issues Which are valid. 

The final act again is a greater parody which on a superficial look will look like a manifesto of feminism but any able minded person who looks closer will understand she's just criticising that too much of anything is shite and world needs balance of both. 

Also Ken is done beautifully they explored rom com angle through him and led to greater themes and it worked.

I particularly like the acknowledgment that Barbieland is a matriarchy and that Ken's obsession with patriarchy stemmed from finding self-worth, given his whole existence was to be a side piece to Barbie and that men largely have nothing there. The little bit at the end with them trying to find a spot in the government so they could have a voice and after the entire film they were still like 'nah lol' was pretty amusing, and it was nice that they pretty much outright stated that the Barbies were fighting to make kens go back to being second class citizens.

I know none of that was largely the point of the movie, but it would have felt wrong if they didn't bring that up at all, which they did.

Funny & satircal.
Visually beautiful.
I just wish the point was more concise in the end.
It feels like it never nailed a main point.
But still very entertaining.
Kate & Will were great.
Ryan Gosling was hilarious.
I wish it was like 20 minutes longer.
Great soundtrack.
That Billie Eilish scene. Damn. Beautiful.
Funny perfect ending. Reminded me of the ending of Bodies Bodies Bodies with the Charlie XCX song.
Which made me feel the A24ness of the whole movie.

Stay through til the end of the credits to listen to that beautiful Billie song 

It felt like a weird 90s movie.

Sumptuous photography and Great casting, but Ryan Gosling is just on another level. Lord, he is so goddamn funny in this, Margo essentially becomes his ""straight man"" and plays off him beautifully.

The movie actually makes it a point to highlight how men can also be effected by the new paradigm of ‚Äúfemale empowerment‚Äù and made to feel insignificant and the importance of celebrating their unique qualities and talents as well.

The second time it was much more infrequent. Sold out show both times and even saw it on the same day of the week and and similar time.

I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs because a lot of people are seeing it for the 2nd time or if the jokes have been spoiled on tiktok for newcomers.

I thought the movie would be more self aware and explore the ideas of promoting unrealistic standards of beauty and rampant consumerism, but those issues are just raised and handwaved away.

And I‚Äôm sorry, the idea that Barbie‚Äôs had a huge impact on expanding kids‚Äô imagination is bullshit.  The company did the opposite by chasing dollars and sales by making different Barbies for every situation imaginable, which STIFLES kids‚Äô imaginations, not promotes it, when you have a new commercial every month shoving a new Barbie theme down kids‚Äô throats just so they buy another Barbie.

1035,"I felt like such an Allan at my screening. Lost among a sea of Barbies who don't give a shit about me...

Anyway, this movie was fucking amazing. It's an existential crisis marauding as kids fare, but it's original and completely subversive. I definitely was not expecting it to go places it did, and taking the concept all the way to its logical conclusion. Margot and Ryan were both fantastic in the roles. Reminded me a little bit of Toy Story and a little bit of Elf. I thought the scenes with the mother and daughter were also pretty touching. And of course the fact that Ken become ""toxic"" after only a short visit to the real world. That's definitely some heavy content for a product carrying the Barbie brand. Oh yeah, and the songs were pretty catchy too.

I guess I connected to it in a weird way, based on how shit everything is in this world. It's funny, because I was thinking back to the latest episode of It's Always Sunny last night (""Dennis Takes a Mental Health Day""), and in some ways, this was the perfect parallel. Both of them ended in a kind of transcendental dreamlike wonder. I don't know, I guess I'm pretty fucked up. Definitely wasn't expecting Barbie to be one of my favorite films of 2023, but here we are. (Also the first Greta Gerwig film I thoroughly enjoyed.)

That being said, I think this Barbenheimer thing was a bust for me. I much preferred my own double feature from earlier this year, Evil Dead Rise/Beau is Afraid.",2023-07-21 10:10:54,15,movies,lonelygagger,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
1036,"For a movie so unabashedly about feminism in almost every way, it's insanely ironic that the Ryan Gosling and all the Ken scenes steal the freakin' show and are pretty much all I remember about the movie. It's almost like Margot/Barbie took a back seat in her own movie for most of it, or simply just had the most plain scenes. It didn't help they didn't let her have any character or personality, which is ofcourse the point to a degree, but for everyone around her to be way more fascinating just seems like a strange oversight coming from Greta Gerwig. I'm just imagining all the creative executive meetings and hammering out the script about how Barbie needs more agency, control, and that these things need to lead to on the nose commentary about society that they just simply forgot to give the character any memorable moments outside of the opening sequence. I liked it alot and found it to be very funny, but there's quite a lot of flaws. Will Ferrel went all the way to Barbieland to do...nothing. And the resolution of this movie was like 30 whole minutes, it was ""over"" for quite awhile but then we got a montage for...reasons. Simu was fantastic, I hope we get to see more of him in the sequel. Also wish we got more of Dua Lipa and John Cena. But this movie is gonna be a hit, so hopefully we just get more of everything on the next one. Major props to set design, VFX, costume, and cinematography, this movie was a feast for the eyes.

1041,"In the spirit of its ""all about Men"" theme that some reviewers have taken lets a look at some of those aspects in more detail:  
  
**Satire of Male Superiority**: The film gives satirical treatment of Ken's journey from a ""needy beau"" to a ""swaggering, macho doofus."" His transformation is an exaggeration of stereotypes associated with masculinity and serves to critique the idea of male superiority. It should also be seen as a mirror satire of ""female inferiority"" and the sterotypes assocaited with that in the real world.  
  
**Mockery of Corporate Gender Politics**: The depiction of Mattel's headquarters and CEO subtly critiques corporate attempts to appear diverse and progressive while maintaining a patriarchal system. This critique extends the discussion of toxic masculinity into the corporate world, demonstrating how such behaviors can permeate different levels of society. It was telling that the CEO was verbally ""all about female empowerment"" and yet that wasn't followed through with any actual actions despite ""gender neutral restrooms up the wazoo"".  
  
**Subversion of Male Stereotypes**: The character of Allan, who is ""bumbling awkwardly in a sea of hunky Kens,"" serves to subvert the stereotype of the hyper-masculine male, further challenging toxic masculinity. Allan is in many ways the unexpected hero fighting for the mother and daughter. He doesn't have muscles but ""Just Allen"" is enough and Barbie would probably be better off with Allen. Allen is an everyman who doesn't attempt to fit into to the hyper masculine world of ""Beach"" Ken. However his heroic efforts go under appreciated.   
  
**The Struggle for Male Identity**:  Ken's existential struggle is examined, showcasing his dependency on Barbie for identity affirmation. His journey towards self-discovery and self-definition is a key aspect of dismantling toxic masculinity, as it stresses the importance of individuality and emotional authenticity over conformity to traditional masculine roles.  
  
In sumamry the film is kenough of a satire of toxic masculinity that I laughed all the way through it. Its not anti men there are positive male role models too, not least the self discovery of Ken.   
  
Its almost perfect, a masterpeice.",2023-07-26 09:58:53,15,movies,jonpojonpo,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1058,"I'm curious what everyone thinks of the ending where Barbie realizes she's no longer perfect, and that she's also not the ""smart"" Barbie or the leadership oriented Barbie. She realizes she is not ""extraordinary"" in any way. Did you feel like they got a resolution or a message across? Or was the message that to be a woman is impossible because you can't do anything right, and you can't possibly wear all these different hats. Being a mom, and president; or being a bikini model, and supreme court justice. They just kind of threw in America Ferrera's suggestion that I think rang true for most women, what about being average? What about a Barbie who's not extraordinary in any way? No matter who you are or what you do -- majority of life is carrying out mundane rituals of bodily maintenance (showering, eating, going to the doctor.) Hence why those are the first things to go when Barbie Land crumbles and also the last jab of a joke. 

I think America Ferrera's speal about it being impossible to be a woman hit the nail on the head but I think the montage of home videos sort of made me lose the message. Children are pure potential? Barbie is pure potential? 

In the emotional scene with Ruth where Barbie asks to be human and Ruth explains she never needed permission she has full autonomy to be who she wants to be and Barbie grapples with how confusing it is to know what you want. It's hard to have autonomy and make your own decision, hence why the Barbie's so easily go from being a neurosurgeon to serving the Ken's food and loving being an accessory to the Ken's. Because making your own decisions, having your own money, career, ambitions, property is HARD. And quite frankly us humans are perhaps not meant to do it alone. It would've been interesting to see them explore relationship dynamics and attachment within the patriarchy and feminist world that was clashing. Like this narrative that women need to be girl bosses and prove they can do it all -- like live alone or support a family when in reality I don't think humans were meant to be alone, we were meant to pair bond. Maybe that's why they emphasized the Mother and daughter dynamic so much. Made me think of how much I hated my mom when I was a tween and now I think the world of her and remind her all the time how obsessed I am with her. I think these were all universal human experiences especially for women. There is no real thoughts here just spitballing stream of consciousness but would love to hear others thoughts. 

Through writing this I was able to flesh out some ideas that are still forming. I honestly like the movie even more now after analyzing it further and can't wait to go see it again.",2023-07-22 00:25:21,14,movies,No-Professional1440,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

In all, I don‚Äôt feel like the story was coherent after the conflict point (after the Kens all fight). The last act felt rushed to get to an ending. It was a higher thinking movie than I originally anticipated, but we asked for originality from Hollywood and Gerwig delivered an original Barbie story, so kudos to that.

However, it seemed like there were some issues behind the scenes when it came to what story this production wanted to tell. I strongly suspect there were a lot of ideas and perspectives about the themes of feminism, female agency, adolescence, matriarchy vs patriarchy, etc. that were suggested by writers/producers/directors ‚Äî some of which weren‚Äôt compatible with one another or even contradicted each other ‚Äî but were nonetheless all incorporated into the film in some way.

1067,"Anyone else think the real world stuff was kinda just bad? Will Ferrell and the CEOS were irrelevant, I could have done totally without them. America Ferrera's character and her daughter have basically no depth or development in this, basically went ""grr I hate my mom she's cringe"" to ""okay I fw my mom"" with pretty much nothing having had happened aside from them watching Barbie find out her world has been invaded by Patriarchy. They spend a not insignificant amount of time showing a Chevrolet commercial, just a bizarre choice. Insanely corporate film littered with Lin Manuel Miranda, 2016-ass politics, where we soapbox about the problems we face while winking at the fact that this is a corporation perpetuating many of these same problems. 

I've seen twitter accounts handwaving the depth of the feminist message by saying its meant to be for children or for people who have never engaged with any left leaning feminist thinking. I don't know what to make of that, this idea that its done poorly or shallowly on purpose. It's a weird movie. For every decision that I liked and really enjoyed it feels like there was one that was absolutely repellant or did not land at all. I don't know who this movie is for, yet in that I think it loops around to being for anyone. it is a mirror, with several possible readings and interpretations possible as to what the messaging is meant to be. I cannot decide if this is the films greatest strength or its greatest weakness. It simultaneously flaunts a myriad of possibility while holding you at arm's length, laughing that you dare engage critically with a movie about toys.  I think its nowhere near Lady Bird or Little Women, but the more I sit with it the more confused I feel about it both in positive and negative ways. The whole viewing experience has become pretty ironic for me in that I came into it expecting a complex portrayal in the vein of Lady Bird/Little Women hidden under Barbie aesthetics, was met with hamfisted in your face depictions lathered in Barbie aesthetics, yet find that the messages in their simplicity do not form anything resembling a perfect puzzle, they contradict and they twist meanings as you hold them side by side.

Idk. I have it sitting at a 3/5 rn but I feel like I need to watch it again, drop my expectations, and maybe just engage with it on its own terms. I will say the first 20 minutes and the final 10-15 were excellent, I just feel like the middle hour connecting those two portions was just weird",2023-07-24 17:03:12,14,movies,marquesasrob,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1072,"Saw with my blonde barbie girlfriend after watching Oppenheimer, was really fun. I don't think it's a film that requires a lot of analysis or a lot of viewings to understand everything, it was very forward with its point and delivered it really well with comedy.

People don't like how the kens were portrayed, but half the point at least is that women are presented as 1 dimensional clueless hot things for like...all of western civilization, so it kind of blows my mind we can't let them have a couple of movies where they do that to men.There's lots of feminists media I've seen where I agree with the point but they do it so badly and in such an unfunny way that I immediately cringe. 

Unfortunately that's been most feminist media for me.Barbie hit different though, because it didn't try to hide, and when it did spill it out in your face, it wasn't deceptive about it at all, and because of the tone of the movie, it worked. Plus it was just...funny.The end of the movie with the older lady was a lil too preachy for me but heck it did fit and I'm sure a lot of people liked how it made them feel.",2023-07-25 13:03:17,14,movies,EarlEarnings,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

But it ended up being a movie that felt like a balm on what happens to women in the real world. The real world is horrifying, in our country, in every corner of this world, horrible things are happening to women, constantly, every day. So to be able to go to a place where women are free, can literally be anything they want to be, are supported, and are supportive felt surreal to see. It made you feel everything you go through on a daily basis, everything you overcome and ignore so that you can lead a normal life. America Ferrera‚Äôs monologue was amazing and in the words of Ryan Gosling‚Äôs glorious Ken, to remember that you are Kenough! That is just what I needed in the moment.

1086,"This may be a simple take, but I think it is accurate. I think the main goal of the movie was to promote barbie as well as make money. I think they poured a majority of the funding into hiring well known actors and toeing a super controversial line as much as they could while offending nobody and everyone at the same time. People thrive on controversy and polarity. If you look at the social media, you can see the the most promoted videos and topics are the ones with the most comments. More comments are driven by polarizing people. I think the barbie movie aimed to do just that. It's a clear promotion of feminism while sprinkling a bit of pro-men's ideas in here and there. Lines like ""human's made up the patriarchy"" and ideas like manipulation from women strike from the opposite angle. This portrays the idea that the movie is in fact a satire. Think about it, isnt satire usually pretty obvious, at least in more than 2% of any story? But then the rest of the movie heavily doubles down on pro-feminist ideology. Honestly when I tried to see both of these ideas at the same time, I was just confused. On one hand it seemed to scream pro-feminism, then on the other hand it screamed satire. I know ideas are not mutually exclusive, but this seems to be one of the times that they are. Barbie probably doesn't care at all how you feel about feminism or men's issues. They just want you to keep talking about it and fighting so that they can generate more buzz, leading to watching the movies they make and investigating the company they have.

And then they immediately go back to Barbieland and any fear I had was immediately put aside. That last hour of the movie, when Ken is revealed as the ‚Äúvillain,‚Äù is the hardest I have laughed in the theater in a LONG time. Just non-stop jokes that fired on every cylinder for me.

1094,"Overall I really enjoyed this movie-- the Barbie nostalgia, amazing sets and costumes, and the surprising amount of sometimes very harsh self aware humor were great. I felt the goal of empowering women and acknowledging where society is failing them was well communicated.

America Ferreira's speech is awesome: an affecting summary of the contradictory roles women that society expects them to perform-- all while Barbie, a physical representation of that oppression, is breaking down from it as well as the thought that she was built off of it. But, as the characters mention afterwards, by putting these struggles into words, we now have an understanding of how insane these expectations are, and that we can choose to be free from it.

I think where this movie starts to fail is when it comes to Ken and men in general. His story and arc were really messy IMO, and it sucks because the movie started to touch on some really interesting ideas here that I wish they had expanded on:

1) I don't think they communicated that Ken was an incel for Barbie til later in the movie (I interpreted the ""every night is girls' night"" as the dolls' general obliviousness to sex). Even near the end though, I didn't feel like Barbie and Ken's reconciliation felt right. Barbie apologizes to Ken for taking him for granted, but she has nothing to apologize for-- she makes it clear that they're not together or that she's into him, and she should have the right to spend her time the way she likes.

The whole scene is actually really counterproductive, because women often acquiesce to men IRL because they feel bad for letting down a guy who likes them. I wish that scene had gone more along the lines of Barbie drawing a clear boundary in their relationship and defending her choices, while at the same time encouraging him to move on, gain confidence in himself, and learn more about himself as a person.

(edit: I read some more thoughts on this apology, and that it's more about how men feel lost or marginalized in a feminist world. I agree that sometimes feminism sidelines men and that that sucks, and I wish this had come across more clearly in that apology scene.)

2) The way conflicts were solved was also very toxic. The Barbies literally emotionally manipulate the Kens into fighting one another to foil the election. Not that any incels are gonna see the Barbie movie, but this is like pure incel fuel-- they hate women and think of them as tricksters, and it's also shitty to represent the Kens as bumbling war-obsessed jealous idiots.

This is such a huge failure IMO because it provides yet another poor example of how to healthily talk about problems between the sexes. I would have preferred that the Barbies (after all getting deprogrammed) successfully win over the patriarchy Kens' respect, and that they rebuild Barbieland together.

The icing on this shitty cake is when the Barbies humorously tell the Kens they can't be in the Supreme Court, and will have to start at the lower courts. WTF? This excuse-- oh sure, we can be equal, but you need to start on the bottom rung-- is used on women IRL and it fucking blows. (And no, I'm not advocating that women be insta-promoted or hired without the relevant knowledge/experience for a job, but pointing out that women to this day still do not hold many positions of power, and are relegated to lower positions)

3) Mattel pokes fun at itself in some surprisingly subversive ways, but by the end of the movie never actually answers for some its more heinous crimes. It's a funny scene when Will Ferrel bumbles over how there are no women on the Director's Board, yet we see no resolution to this issue. When America Ferreira suggests the idea of a regular Barbie to help with womens' self esteem issues, it's written off as not being lucrative. 

The translation of Barbie and Kens to women and men also doesn't quite work, because Ken IS an accessory to Barbie because that's just what the toy is... so unless Mattel is intending to make Ken dolls just as prolific as Barbies, the message doesn't really land right.

Overall, I think it's a good movie, but the discussion around gender roles is still extremely complicated, and for how self deprecating it gets at times, I wish it could have provided a more honest and healthy example for how to deal with these complexities in the real world.",2023-07-23 19:25:38,14,movies,CadavreExquisite,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1097,"There are so many contradictory messages in the Barbie movie which tell you one message but show you another when it comes to men.

The movie has this attitude of ‚Äúfeminism knows what‚Äôs best for men and has their best interests at heart‚Äù, but also it contradicts itself and laughs at men for doing what the movies message says is alright and non toxic for men to do.

So for instance when Barbie cries it‚Äôs serious - when Ken cries it‚Äôs played for laughs - yet the movie is also trying to give us the message it‚Äôs alright for men to cry. 

The movie supposedly also tells us it‚Äôs alright for men to be who they really want to be and not have to play a role, yet the Kens expressing male interests is shown as a joke to be mocked.

In my opinion the movie is on the same level as some old movie which purports to have a good potrayal and message for black people - but shows them all as stereotypical, less intelligent and mocks their way of talking and living.

To me this is a movie made by bigots and enjoyed most by bigots who can‚Äôt see the problems inherent in it, or are able to excuse them for ideological reasons (like it‚Äôs alright to punch up on your ‚Äúoppressors‚Äù). And I think more people will see it that way in the future.

1100,"Why I didn't like the Barbie movie - a feminist view

So to start off with, I want to make it absolutely clear I am a feminist. A proud one. If you're here to hate on the feminist messages that the Barbie movie is attempting to make, you're in the wrong place. 

I just wanted to share my feelings and see if I'm alone in this? I am a feminist. I didn't like the Barbie movie. I feel a bit called out by people constantly saying you're anti-feminist or this movie isn't for you if you didn't like it (I'm a woman). 

So first I'll say what I did like, then I'll go on to the reasons I didn't like the movie.

I did like the feminist tone in as far as America Ferrara's character doing the monologue on the struggles of the modern woman. This is needed. And it needs to be repeated until it's heard. I'm just not sure this movie was the avenue for it for reasons I'll get into. I also liked the set design, costume design, casting, diversity. I liked weird Barbie and the idea that Ken discovered the patriarchy. I liked that Barbie didn't need a man to make her happy. There's a lot of good in this. 

So now, what I didn't like:

1. This feels to me very much like Mattel trying to rewrite the Barbie narrative to sell more capitalistic shit. They lean heavily into the ""Barbie has always been so feminist, she was an astronaut when women couldn't have credit cards"" angle. 

Which may be true. But it's not the whole truth. Barbie was also a major contributor to body image issues. She was only white and thin and blonde for so long (until they realised money could be made from change). 

Barbie only also promotes one way to be a woman. Hyper feminine, positive, everything's a pleasure, no trouble at all. 

Barbie's dream house and car etc now being reframed as independence are really just ways to sell more stuff. It's just capitalism. It's just branding. Why didn't they lean into Barbie bring a feminist earlier if she always was? 

Truth is, they realised dream houses would sell so they made dream houses. 

Also didn't Ruth Handler invent Barbie with her husband? Why are they not mentioning that? 

I feel like this is just a poor attempt from Mattel to get in front of the game before people start accusing them of being anti-woman and rewriting history. Am I alone in this?

2. The story line was piss poor and made no real sense. It had no structure and you had no idea where it was going half the time. The daze the Barbies went into and how they came out made no sense. How did they get brainwashed?? 

3. While it goes on about how feminist it is two bits really stood out to me as being problematic. The first is in the fact that the thing that compels Barbie to go to the real world and save the girl (that's who she thought at the time) wasn't any of the issues women face in the real world. It was cause she wanted to fix her cellulite. 

The scene where stereotypical Barbie has a break down when she comes back to Barbie land and she's upset because she doesn't feel important or attractive. It's almost made to be like this moment that every woman is able to relate to. The expectation to be everything, to be too much, to never be enough. But then they fuck it up with a voiceover which is like ""note to film makers, Margot Robbie was not the right casting choice if you wanted to make that point"" after she says she feels ugly ....

Umm how did no one on this set realise how that is going against the grain that everything that scene was trying to achieve? 

Like we all struggle with body image, but you shouldn't if you're thin and blonde like Margot Robbie? Was that meant to be relatable? 

4. I really hated the 'self aware' Mattel shenanigans.  So disingenuous.

1101,The Matchbox Twenty stuff had me absolutely dying. Also my girlfriend gave me the strongest side eye with the cutaway to the husband doing Duolingo‚Ä¶ when I was also doing my Spanish Duolingo just hours before almost identically,2023-07-21 06:21:17,14,movies,Packer224,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
1102,"So bit of a pretentious knob starting statement, but I‚Äôm a film student, I‚Äôm a bloke, and I‚Äôve written about female agency in films previously (by choice). I focused on how it‚Äôs neglected in certain films and Hollywood in general with close analysis. I watched this with my girlfriend, and I would class my politics as centre left.

I would give Barbie an 8-9/10 for the current climate of boxoffice releases. It‚Äôs as close a thing to a classic as there‚Äôs ever been in the past few years, and the aesthetic choices, choreography etc were all memorable. It does lose some of its semblance in its monologues, but it mostly holds up because it uses those monologues to create more jokes, with biting commentary that makes sense. 

However, as others have pointed out, there are contradictions in its messaging. 

I think the viewpoints that have been expressed by the American right wing are bullshit, but they do have a point that it‚Äôs not exactly a film that comes with a wholly positive message about men even though obviously we go into this knowing it‚Äôs a film primarily directed towards women. On the one level I get the joke about Ken being superfluous, and I understand that it may be purposefully targeting patriarchy because we do still need to remain vigilant of extremism and oppression, especially right now with culture wars etc. But in terms of what it actually does to address the culture wars, it‚Äôs definitely a film that‚Äôs happier to stoke the flames. There were three moments where I thought well maybe they‚Äôll resolve it, but it did not, and so I assume the point was not to resolve it and to spread the message that we need to be separate people, discover ourselves, blah blah blah. But that‚Äôs where it loses me. Like the stereotypical male stuff in the film was really funny, the interests applied to me pretty frickin‚Äô well. But I see more likelihood that the internet will start referring to people as ‚Äòa Ken‚Äô to describe a sort of basic guy, rather than take a message of let people be themselves. Maybe Ken itself is a commentary on the way people define women as basic bitches etc etc, but that feels pretty weak to me, and tenuous at best. The Kens had genuine interest in subjects, they were excited to share things with Barbies, and they were continually told they didn‚Äôt know who they were or what they wanted OR they were belittled for it. 

Ken being rejected as a partner is fine. But I think the message of Ken discovering things he likes and then being told to find himself is massively conflicting. He was rejected as a person. Is that the point? Like they were mostly pretty banal, ordinary, funny things barring the patriarchy (which he only liked because of horses anyway). It‚Äôs not the type of stuff men have to be indoctrinated into liking as if those things solely belong to a frat kid or Andrew Tate or Joe Rogan, which to me was how it was presented. I think in that instance the comedy just doesn‚Äôt work with the undertones. The comedy part was funny and worked as a standalone, but the undertones of the Barbies invalidated the men having interests. Like again, is that the point? 

The Barbies also intentionally made the Kens jealous to make them fight each other, and I think it‚Äôs fine for media like film to express and show a particular perspective in general, but with a film this big I found it slightly morally questionable because it was treated as justifiable. It was pretty toxic behaviour - most people would not respond well to it, but it‚Äôs justified because dismantling male structures??? Like, again, the comedy and the undertone just don‚Äôt mix well. I like the joke but the undertone felt wrong enough that my girlfriend was the first person to mention it afterwards. 

What stood out the most was the ‚Äòyou have to be x and you have to be y‚Äô speech compared to attitudes about the Kens. However, ironically, despite it standing out, a few hours later I can‚Äôt remember the speech so I can‚Äôt think of any solid examples now. 

It just seems a bit out of touch that a film so intent on individualism, expression, identity and humanity doesn‚Äôt fully reconcile that men have similar issues. I think it tried to partially, but it didn‚Äôt feel complete, and all it needed was a slightly more unified statement at the end. It was a clear this is our territory and we‚Äôre claiming it as women thing, but I think me and my girlfriend felt a bit alienated because we look at each other as people/individuals already, above just being men and women. And one of the speeches at the end, about a woman being free to be/do whatever she wants, felt a bit redundant and ham fisted given that it‚Äôs the sentiment expressed by Barbies in the beginning. I just don‚Äôt really know what it was trying to accomplish. To me it just reinforced a gender division. I grew up around feminists and division was not the kind of viewpoint that was expressed to me. Equity was. This film felt like it was Malcom X rather than Martin Luther King, not wholly aggressive, validly hostile, but perhaps anti integration in a way that I think most people don‚Äôt agree with.

Tl;Dr

1107,"Maybe I went there with high expectations (everyone who‚Äôd seen it was raving about it).

I thought it went on about the whole patriarchy thing for way too long; you kind of get it soon and want to move onto something else as it gets tiring.

I didn‚Äôt like the way ‚Äúwhat men are supposed to be like‚Äù get portrayed lately (not just in this movie). They appear goofy, bit dim, completely emasculated etc. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be a middle ground. It‚Äôs just too extreme. I just don‚Äôt think this kind of thing does the sex ‚Äúdiscrepancies‚Äù much justice.

I thought that towards the end they‚Äôll even things out a bit and bring the sexes together.

Oh and the beach scene towards the end just made women look deviously manipulative and unreasonably cruel. 

I think there‚Äôs a real risk it‚Äôll achieve the opposite effect of what it was trying to do (bringing both sexes together). 

All in all it was kind of childish, primitive, one sided and missed the mark somehow. But I get why it ‚Äúculturally necessary‚Äù right now.

1108,"6/10. I'm not sure how Greta Gerwig feels about Barbie, but it felt like another Velma (incept better) in this case it felt like it was taking this beloved character and using this character to voice an opinion on society. It was funny in some ways but after a while it seemed most the jokes were insults towards the Kens/men in general and towards Barbie for being imperfect at first. I came in to the theatre, as did many others, expecting this fun, enjoyable film about Barbie and Ken in the real world but came out with mixed messages. It's very memorable and the set and costume design is awesome, props to that team but the messages were a little too much. Also I'd hate to be a kid watching this, I don't think they'd understand a lot of it. It would have been much better if both Barbie and Ken shared a land and a house instead of all the Ken's being told no that they couldn't have cool important jobs like the Barbies.",2023-07-23 10:37:08,14,movies,HeavymetalCambion,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
1109,"My wife and daughter (15) went to this last night. Both didn't like it and found the ending depressing. Wife told me it's not fun, not funny, VERY preachy and not a kids film. Both enjoyed first half hour. I'm curious as to who the target audience is for this film. It certainly doesn't seem to be little kids who like to play happy fun games with Barbie and ken. There is a reason why the transformers and Lego films were so successful. They are fun kids films based on a kids toy franchise for kids and with a few jokes for the parents. That's what I presumed Barbie film would be. Obviously not.

Edit. I personally have no problems with this film, I didn't see it as it doesn't sound like my thing. Visuals look great. I'm just posting this as alot of women I work with are planning on bringing their daughters to it and are expecting a very different kind of film to what my wife described.

1118,"MOVIE COMBO : BARTRIX (BARBIE x MATRIX) 

Many people got into the hype of Oppenheimer and Barbie, but I have another combo to offer. 
I highly recommend watching Barbie and then rewatching the 1999 Matrix. 
To celebrate Warner's 100 years anniversary, they had special showing of famous and critically claimed movie, and the week I went to watched Barbie, Matrix was showing. I regret nothing ! Watching Matrix in theatre right after Barbie was amazing! Both of those movies comment on our reality. 

One does it with an absurd, chaotic, and colourful atmosphere, while the other is an absurd, chaotic, and dark action movie. 

Aside from the iconic pills moment, both share many other aspects, like using the same scheme of parallel world. Even though inside the Matrix, the world is not perfect like Barbieland, the world outside the Matrix is so much worse. 

Some argue that the Weird Barbie is like Morpheus. Indeed, both of them were touched by the real world, and both revealed to the protagonist that their idea of their world is far from the truth. 

Also, let's go back to the pills' choice for a moment. In Matrix, Neo does not seem to hesitate to take the red pill, whereas Barbie doesn't want to know the harsh reality. She wants to go back to her bliss ignorance. And that, right there is so interesting and reveals a hard fact about humans. Although many of us like to believe that we would gladly take the truth, in reality, many would rather stay in their ignorance and deny the hard reality. Especially if said truth will negatively impact their comfort. And I'm seeing it with the hate from men towards feminism. 

Not convinced yet? MATTEL executives are like the Smiths. They even run a but like them! They do it in a more absurd and comical way, but they kinda do. The way their arms swings while their body stay still !",2023-07-27 10:57:54,14,movies,ardamou,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1122,"I really enjoyed the movie. I absolutely love how they went all in on the absurdity and surreal humor. 

The ending was actually a lot different than I expected. I was waiting for both the Barbies and Kens to learn from the experience, as they had both been the oppressors, and form a more equal society, moving away from either extreme of toxic masculinity or femininity. Essentially the Barbie Land ends up going back to being a dystopian society instead of changing at all. It's a pretty dark ending if you really think about it. Now the Kens know what it's like to have freedom but are forced to go back into a life of submission to the Barbies. 

I feel like maybe the intent was to show Barbie Land was just as flawed as the real world, which is why ""our"" barbie wanted to escape it and be a human. But it was sorta disappointing that everything that happened was basically for nothing, and the Kens just go back to being second class citizens. Especially because we see they aren't evil, just misguided, and they feel pain and emotion just like the Barbies.",2023-07-23 12:49:00,14,movies,Fact0ry0fSadness,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

I felt like both conceptually and storyline-wise it was similar to a lot of things that have come before, which is no bad thing. Even the execution, while not the ""standard"" Hollywood fare, wasn't massively surrealist.

When the Barbies' restore their oppressive system they force the ken's to have a menial and powerless lower court judge position, refusing to give them equality.

On further reflection, I'd say the movie really reminded me of USS callister, that one really excellently written and good episode of Black mirror that was also fundamentally carrying a pretty nasty message about how you shouldn't feel like you have to be nice to socially awkward. Weird nerds.

This gave me the same kinds of vibes as that, but it was done even more skillfully such that even though there's a lot of humiliating men for the sake of it and I feel like I should be annoyed about that. I still kind of laughed along with it. So Kudos to Greta Gerwig.

Part of it is that there was just enough nuance and kindness, even if it was a very very partial and grudgingly given like can getting a chance to make something of himself even if he's still clearly an idiot and doesn't actually achieve anything by the end of the movie.

So I did indeed see Barbie and Oppenheimer together and I'm just saying that
there's a scene in oppenheimer where he's pouring his heart out about his guilt to Emily blunt and she's pretending to be sympathetic and then loses patience with him, that would literally fit in that scene in Barbie movie where the kens are pouring out their hearts to the Barbies. Physicist ken. Also he literally had Jean Tetlock be his long distance low commitment casual girlfriend. He loves going on random self important tangents and quoting things, people call him a dilletante, womanizer and insecure, neurotic. There's even an early scene in the movie where he's pursuing Jean before he became a bigshot physicist and she rejects him and he sulks off.

1142,"My wife and I went to see ""Barbie"" again this weekend, and to our renewed joy, it was just as much fun as the first time, probably more so because I wasn't laughing so hard that I missed as many lines!  
  
When Barbie sits down at the bus stop, takes a moment to look at the real world and start to digest what she's seeing, she looks over at the old woman and recognizes her beauty.  
  
I loved this because it's true that older people are beautiful, but it also reflects that even Barbieland, they are aware of age and death in the real world, which could partially explain Barbie's recent thoughts about dying.  
  
""You are so beautiful.""  
  
""I know!""  
  
This moment of acknowledgment, recognition, and connection just captivated me, and I really, REALLY wanted them to exchange just a few more lines. Something small but very zen that would be a succinct but powerful expression of the themes of the film and Barbie's journey.

1144,"The more I think about the movie the more the narrative makes absolutely no sense.

Like why if that is the way Barbie is made sad can‚Äôt America Ferrara just fix the Barbie and Ken fight and make their Barbie world better, given that it‚Äôs been established that what she does in the real world effects Barbie land?


I know some people will say I‚Äôm thinking about it too much but even a goofy fantasy movie has to have some sense of logic and continuity, there are so many things in this movie that make absolutely no sense story wise. Yet they‚Äôre overlooked because the movie had a message for women that‚Äôs a satire or something. I get that - but shouldn‚Äôt the actual plot make some sense?

1146,"Greta Gerwig‚Äôs Barbie is the perfect concoction of summer blockbuster and satire which goes through a hilarious tale about A barbie who believes herself and existence to have solved the woes of women, but enters the real world to see otherwise. The shock and the satire create for a fun filled ride along the way.

The most beautiful part about this movie is that it never takes itself seriously. There is not a more than two minute sequence that takes itself serious. It‚Äôs the perfect comedy that acknowledges many of the flaws of the society we have built, it‚Äôs inequalities, consumerism, capitalism, sexism, and more.

I truly appreciated that the point of the movie doesn‚Äôt end up that patriarchy is bad as someone may expect with how Barbie understands the real world. The movie moves onto show Ken recreating a patriarchal world in Barbieland which stems from him feeling oppressed and living in the shadow of Barbie. There is a necessary discourse laced with the right amount of fun satire through Ken‚Äôs journey. He is always in the shadow and his existence has no meaning without Barbie, which he deserves to change. Everyone has that right to be themselves, and as a society we should thrive to create a world which is moving towards such equality but as with everything this takes time. The movie acknowledges this reality in a beautiful way towards the end saying hopefully the status of Ken‚Äôs will come equal to that of women in the real world. The smart dialogue which packages the satire and the themes of the story truly helps it.

The movie deals with the idea of dominance and the film wraps this idea with a story that shows you why we should move away from someone having the upper hand. This is all topped off by the literal ending (I loved how meta this movie got) given to Barbie where it shows that we truly can be what we want to be. The movie does this all in a tone that at times feels like I am navigating through r/ELI5 rather than in a movie. Regardless the move has some layered writing with witty dialogues and satire. It doesn‚Äôt try to change the world but show the world as it is for the most part though the overarching narrative does nudge us towards progress for creating an equal and happy society.

The world of the film is beautiful. Greta Gerwig excelled in creating this world of Barbieland and how they represented Mattel (was thoroughly surprised by the level of criticism they got away with giving kind of shocked me). The colors popped as much as we wished it too, but I was a little worried about whether the hot pinks and bright colors would get too much but surprisingly never had that issue. I was sucked into the world and had fun every second, didn‚Äôt even remember that I brought snacks to eat. The board room design was also really fun and had me laughing at how the board members operated, loved Will Ferrell in that role.

The soundtrack of this movie is unexpectedly good. I loved every second of the song they broke into in between the Ken War. They didn‚Äôt miss the writing even in song. I can‚Äôt help but remember the lady behind me in the theater who couldn‚Äôt stop laughing. I was waiting for the It‚Äôs a Barbie Girl song and was so sad I needed to wait til the credits but happy it finally arrived. My mom who listens to little Western music came home and asked me to play the songs which is a great sign.

Honestly need to talk about the performances. Margot Robbie was Barbie, I can‚Äôt say anything more. The movie says it well with a note by the narrator honestly calling out the irony considering Margot Robbie. Ryan Gosling have one of his best performances as Ken, never even thought this would happen. I was surprised by the amount of weight his character had. I was mad that I didn‚Äôt know Michael Cera was in the movie, and was so happy and loved every second of him as Alan (makes sense that I wasn‚Äôt aware of his presence in the film). Will Ferrell is a legend and he has little screen time but kills it with what he has. America Ferreira was just great as a mom who is just leading a plain life but wants something representing her as the most common kind of person. I loved her venting which brought the Ken-struck Barbies back to their senses, it‚Äôs my head canon that it was improv as well. So many great performances, a sign of a fantastically made film which is all I expect from Greta Gerwig.

Overall, it is a well made summer film that surprised you with some great satire and fun. It was a great movie to watch with my family and have fun together with characters and themes that stay with you.",2023-07-24 04:59:21,13,movies,ramaromp,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1153,"It's insane that Mattel actually allowed their brand to be portrayed like this, the fact there's no women in their board of directors is a literal plot point and that the CEO makes a whole speech pathetically trying to explain it.... Like i was genuinely baffled when that scene played. This isn't a compliment or a criticism i'm just shocked.

About the movie itself... i'm sorry but it's such shallow feminism. ""Inequality bad, patriarchy bad, people stupid for creating them"". And it sucks because the entire movie revolves around it. I like the visuals, i like the actors (specially Ryan Gosling, i was one of the people who thought ""why tf him"" when they cast him as Ken but now i can't not see him as Ken), i even think some jokes were funny, but i can't really like the overall package cause it's based on an idea of feminism from a 17 year old twitter user. Like, the movie hammers it pretty hard that patriarchy is bad and shouldn't exiast, and it also makes it clear the 'system' under Barbieland is the same as patriarchy with the Barbies being the men and the Kens being the women, but at the same time it portrays the Kens destroying that system as bad? And the Barbies reinstating the barbiearchy as good? And even make a joke about the Kens not having a say in it?

The implication here is that the barbiearchy is either a good thing or a inevitable thing that you can't really change, and like??? Isn't that literally the opposite of the point of the movie??? This just shows how shallow the movie's messages are.

There's also other stuff like Barbie and Ken getting weird looks from people in LA, they're literally a pretty thin woman and a jacked dude if anything they'd be the ones giving weird looks, or basically any line from that woman's daughter, or the cringy monologue the woman gave... And that's disappointing, a theatrical Barbie movie that touches on the entirety of the Barbie history has so much potential, it's super disappointing how they decided to do it.",2023-07-23 02:38:08,13,movies,Valiosao,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

On the other hand barbie failed to tie all of its sub plots together to bring about a convincing solution for the conflict setup in the first half of the movie. Added to that, the ideas and writing became sloppy and too lazy in the end, which was not helped with the open ending climax. To summarise I felt low after Barbie but not after Oppenheimer.",2023-07-25 23:49:28,13,movies,here_2_judge,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1156,"I really wanted to like this movie, but I was genuinely just kinda lost throughout. It went from existentialism, gender roles, then to feminism, then to patriarchy, then to existentialism and then poof. >!barbie is human!<. 

And I feel like plot-wise, it wasn‚Äôt flowing at all like I had thought which kinda made it a bit frustrating and difficult. For example, >!I was expecting the plot to flow a lot like Elf or Enchanted in which someone from fantasy comes to face reality!<. It didn‚Äôt tho - which is fine - but I was struggling to keep up with what was going on and what exactly the main plot was cause there were like 5. 

Add the fact that I didn‚Äôt really understand a lot of the references‚Ä¶and well‚Ä¶it was just a bit of a bummer.

1158,"When the authoritarian power structure fractured the minority groups to literally fistfight among themselves while they undemocratically changed the constitution...  

Solid 4/5.  I want to see the version without Matell's permission.  Ferrell famously did a version of ""one for them, one for you"" in Letterman's last week (maybe) and I kept thinking about it in terms of Gerwig.  ""I can make any movie I want now.""  She winks at the audience the whole time and the biggest punches were the most subtle.  

I mean at the end of the movie, the girls all win, the status quo is returned; and Barbie frowns.  The Harry Potter reference is obvious but it's pulling from a big well.  It made me think of Carlin as Rufus and *Neverending Story* as well.  Perlman is perfect casting.

I really have not seen all these woke and anti men messages. All the time they spoke about patriarchy it was to make a joke and I don't need Barbie to know that this is a men's world. Sure there is an underlying message but for me it was about accepting ourselves even if we are not perfect.

1176,"am i the only one slightly disappointed with how they wrote out the ending for the Kens?

to preface, i absolutely support the importance of having an identity outside of your partner and i don't think this message was bad at all. i just wish that rather than have barbie being the one to tell ken that he's enough without her, they had the two ken groups come together and engage in meaningful discussion about how they're feeling. this would've shown the importance of platonic male friendship and male support (something that is lacking in our current society or often made fun of when men talk about their feelings with each other and we all know the effects of toxic masculinity).

i feel like they had such a huge opportunity to teach a valuable lesson in what it means to be a man and how to approach/handle male communication in a healthy way. What they did was bring barbie into the picture and depicted her as overshadowing ken, made it her responsibility to tell ken that he's enough. it took away from a really good opportunity to depict that it is okay for men to talk about their feelings with each other, and support each other emotionally without getting bullied or made fun of. i'm thinking of the scene where barbie tells ken that it's okay to cry - i so wish that another ken had told him this, i think it would've made the scene so much more impactful if we saw men reassuring each other that it's okay to feel emotions and guide each other through that process.

i wish this was the focus for the kens at the end (and they totally could've done this in a light, easy to watch way following the style of the movie), men supporting each other and communicating with each other without shame, rather than the message that they put out of ""i'm enough without barbie"" because i feel like this can so easily be misconstrued to ""i don't need barbie to be ken"", and boys/men these days can definitely use a lesson or two on how to treat women (and that's a whole other lengthy discussion).",2023-07-27 18:01:10,13,movies,Nice_Ad9930,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1179,"I loved this movie and loved the way it made certain points.

The movie has one clearly obvious scene and one or two other nods to the matrix depending how deep you look in to it. (Ruth as the oracle, mattel execs being agents)

I think referencing the matrix helps drive the direction of the points they were trying to make about society being blind to systematic oppression. Just like Neo was originally blind to the matrix (even though it felt off). He had to choose to see it and took the red pill. Much the same as barbie had to choose to see the real world and how it functions with men dominating most positions of power. Thats what barbie was blind to. Not the existence of two worlds but that the flip side of the coin in the real world made her have uncomfortable feelings and that is how Ken feels in Barbieland. 

Furthermore, after Barbies retake power they dont bring things back to normal, they give Kens some positions of power and Barbie says to Ken that not every night is girls night. This shows that Barbie has learned from her experience and empathizes with Kens position in Barbieland.

There are other themes that are important to note as well but **systematic oppression taking away a person‚Äôs agency** is the big one. The ending and the specific language used by Ruth and Barbie solidify that for me. They talk about what being a human is, not necessarily a woman and what it is that all humans want (to create and feel that we have made a meaningful impact on the world).

I think Barbie having an existential crisis isnt really a theme but more of a symptom of the mothers life. living in a world built for and by men and the real existential crises in real people that exist in a world not made for or by them. And it makes sense why people would feel that way. 

Before watching the movie I attributed higher rates of anxiety and depression in women to just the way women work. now im considering that maybe its a symptom of a bigger problem and not ‚Äòjust the way women are‚Äô. (Theres tons of research on this but i pulled a semi recent meta analysis to bolster my point here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7892592/)

Its sad that we can be blind to these things but its important to constantly try to make it better. 

Full disclosure Im married, hetero, white, cis, atheistic, college educated, and male. I have typical male gendered interests. I understand why Barbie would make men feel uncomfortable. But the point is that the problem is still ongoing and it is not in the past and you can‚Äôt just bury your head in the sand and ignore problems just because they make you feel bad.",2023-07-24 16:37:41,13,movies,whyUT-urp,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1206,"I knew this movie would be talking about some deep stuff but the beginning felt like a pyschological horror. The fragile utopian society, Barbie just casually bringing up thinking of death (it feels like she's been experiencing this for awhile and we just saw a part of it).  
Honestly Im just amazed how many shots it took with Mattel and Mattel just allowed it.

But some of those jokes were *insane*. Like Depression Barbie and Issa Rae Barbie calling Ken a motherfucker (they shouldve used their one f-bomb pass but whatever),

IK there's a lot of parents complaining about it not being for kids, but like have you SEEN kids nowadays. The jokes they make and the things they say are completely typical for them. I also think its important for anyone to see of any age or gender. Sexualization waits for no one. Many little girls who watched that movie have dealt with objectification. Educating them to stick up for themselves and not conform to a world not made for them is good. Also little boys can learn from Ken that not every attraction they feel from a girl is mutual and they aren't owed anything and building up empathy towards their female peers. 

Another thing is how this and Nimona (another ""kids"" movie I watched reccently, like yesterday) and this movie could have ended their stories at the 1 hr mark like a lesser movie would; The percieved problem is solved and everyone gets their happily ever after. And stretching that out to reach the 1 hr 30 min mark. But they instead dig deeper. Barbie could have just helped out Gloria, learned that she doesnt need to be perfect, roll credits. No, its Barbie also starts to have an exstitential crisis, Ken has his own exstiential crisis which leads to him attempting to establish the patriarchy, Barbie encourages Ken to be his own person, and Barbie becomes her own person.

But I'm not sure I get the whole concept of where this movie was going.  Like it's anti patriarchy, but in ways, anti-feminism (Ken's didn't wind up getting equality unless I missed something).

1208,"I only had a few complaints: that Will Ferrell and minions should have been cut after the chase scene, they didn't add anything and felt inconsistent and under baked. 

Also America Ferrerra's monologue was too long. I agreed with every point and it still made me glaze over. It should have been redistributed in smaller pieces >!to be used to wake each Barbie up. That way they could show that she had as many reasons as there were Barbies and could come up with something unique for each of them without ever running out of talking points. Done all at once it felt more like a grocery list than the ""getting everything off my chest"" moment it was supposed to be. The way they had her list it all out at once and then only took ""waking up"" shots for the un-brainwashing montage while leaving you to assume that she was repeating everything again didn't feel right, it felt disconnected.

1212,"Just watched the movie yesterday and I don't get the big deal.  
I thought the movie was funny at some times and self-aware enough not to be cringe.  
The story was mid at best, nothing in the real world actually mattered, and the CEO character was pretty weak. If I'm going to be harsh, I'd say the fact that they needed to get some middle-aged woman and her daughter take her back to Barbie land and get her to explain everything because the character of barbie was too stupid to come to any conclusions on their own. Everyone also talks about the crazy hard feminist messaging, but all I saw were some pretty surface level takes (Cat calling is bad, women should be CEO, women should be president) and sometimes even that was pretty questionable, like when they showed us how men were more prone to aggression, but then the kens fought for 5 minutes sang about there feelings and became friends again like they couldn't just overthrow the government the day after. At the end of the movie I thought now will come the time when the women take a stand and decide not to go back to the matriarchy because they understood that it was unethical, but instead they just went back to matriarchy for 90% giving us the message that women and men are actually just as bad as the other will always choose to get on top instead of equality and cant be held accountable for anything. I'm not trying to say that the movie was secretly made by women  hating Hollywood stars, I just think it was made by a cringe corporation who wanted to make wide claims on politics without standing on anything, and it shows Mate is shown as a woman loving corporation who is the worst written antagonist ever. I also read that a lot of women cried at the end of the movie because barbie had a mother daughter talk with the old lady, and it feels so cringe, it basically said: ""hey barbie I'm your mo now even though you don't know me and have never made even the slightest effort to be in your life once, but I want to tell you that I love you, and you can become a human now bye forever.""  
TLDR; it's an oke movie with some laughs, everyone who thinks this is even close to extreme feminism does not know what feminism is about.",2024-01-19 12:50:23,12,movies,elbrieko,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1215,"Without the ability to be truly critical of Barbie, this movie does not rise above an ad and the corporate goals made it a bloated mess.

In the real world Mattel bought a German ""call-girl doll"" named Lilli, made for pervy adult men, and re-branded it Barbie. To cover for a very long controversial history this very Mattel funded movie made cartoonish silly billy execs (weirder than Barbie) to take the fall. It's a very clumsy and pointless (other than PR) addition. - Will Farrel needs to catch Barbie, why?

Without this ad agenda (complete with 'make sure it ends on a pro Mattel message'), this could have been a great exploration of gender roles, etc. (and not require a pile of extra characters and ghost saviors).

It's better than the usual brand-first movies (a bit weird there are Barbie actresses with body types they don't actually sell), but disappointing that it is very much in that genre.",2023-07-21 23:05:07,12,movies,whoatemyteeth,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

This movie perfectly mixed in the drama with the comedy too. Some moments hit pretty deep and had my theater crying. The part with Barbie at the bus stop with the old lady was absolutely beautiful. 

Everyone did a wonderful job acting in this. This was perfected casted and everyone was perfect. 

Fuck, the music was perfect. Was that Lizzo singing the wake up song? That was so funny and catchy. I liked sooooo many of the songs in this.

1221,"Watched the movie last night, and my personal takeaway is that the Internet simply has not been normal about it. It‚Äôs a good movie with gorgeous coloring and some very well-done emotional moments (the old woman at the bus stop, the entire mother-daughter arc, the ending with Ruth). Is it corny and on-the-nose? Well, yes. Is it some pinnacle of feminist thought? No. I didn‚Äôt love America‚Äôs speech when I first saw it, but it makes sense in context because her character is very sympathetic imo. I wasn‚Äôt all that floored by Ryan‚Äôs acting and thought Margot was much more memorable. Some of the outrage about how it‚Äôs a slight against feminism not to nominate her or Greta is, uh, interesting. The TikToks I‚Äôve seen reinforce my belief that this generation really struggles with critical media analysis without using online buzzwords. Ultimately, I think it‚Äôs a good movie about girlhood, and the fact that such a corny pastel wonderland got made and then became the biggest film of the year IS a great statement for girls to hear. 

A lot of people have criticized it for providing a simplistic definition of feminism, which, uh, yes? Were you seriously expecting capitalist critique and intersectionality from a movie about a doll? Not every piece of feminist media has to include the maximum amount of nuance. The script was filled with self-aware jokes about how problematic the character of Barbie inherently is (for example, the kid called Barbie a white savior only to be corrected). That‚Äôs about the most intersectionality you can expect from a MOVIE ABOUT BARBIE. I just don‚Äôt think that is relevant critique at all when the movie never claimed to reflect the experience of EVERY woman. At the end of the movie, America suggests a Barbie doll that will represent the average woman who is content with her life but still struggles day-to-day. That‚Äôs basically who the movie is directed towards. There is room in pop culture for a movie like that which does not delve into the struggles of every marginalized group. Barbie covers only one aspect of the female experience, and that‚Äôs okay. 

Finally, Mattel‚Äôs storyline is indeed half-baked, but the movie‚Äôs self-awareness kind of makes up for it. They still mock Mattel until the very end. Is it ironic that this movie is also essentially a commercial for Mattel‚Äôs products? Well, yes. Expecting capitalist critique (beyond lighthearted satire) is also asinine. You‚Äôd be surprised by how few offline people would want to see capitalism criticized anyway. All in all, that part of the story could‚Äôve been done better or excluded altogether, because I don‚Äôt think the self-aware jokes landed that well here.

1226,"Honestly, movie was a ton of fun, absolutely loved it, plenty of laughs. In my cinema we had a good mix of dudes and girls, the dudes were fuckin cracking up with some hearty laughs. So glad it's been recieved well.

I actually got pretty damn emotional during it, like if they stepped up the love just 1% I'd probably have been bawling. I'm not sure why, not sure if it's because I'm about to have a daughter but it really got me, and I've seen the same said elsewhere.

But seriously, parents, can you stop taking your 6 year olds to 12+ films. Jfc, this movie wasn't appropriate for them whatsoever. Also they're really annoying.

>!I guess, seeing a world ran by Women, whereby men come second, and then seeing that destroyed by men spouting those Podcast grindset lines, really makes you do some inner self reflection on your entire setup.

>!I think they could have done more. Mattel wasn't seen as some evil corp? More ignorant and silly, not sure if that was to get the film greenlit or something. Ken not apologizing for everything he did didn't sit right with me either. But I just know if it did, we'd never hear the end of it, so perhaps it was good enough to at least get a conversation going?

I thought the conclusion that the world needs a Barbie doll that addresses the issues women face in the real world, such as cellulite and juggling careers with their family life was bizarre, considering the purpose of a doll is essentially for children to have imaginative, escapist fun, which was incidentally the most successful aspect of the film. I don‚Äôt have children, but I can‚Äôt imagine that the concept of playing with a doll that is divorced, has two children, an office job, bills to pay and PCOS would be particularly entertaining for them. Overall, I had fun, but I greatly prefer Little Women.",2023-07-22 20:14:13,12,movies,RedUlster,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
1229,"I found it to be a frustrating and unfocussed movie experience.

The movie touched superficially on several themes worth exploring (and for which Barbie was a fine starting point) but never committed fully to exploring any of them.

It all felt very self-referencial, I doubt that many people will see the world in a new way thanks to this movie.

Structure and pacing were also an issue, the movie felt very disjointed. Also, the world building felt rushed and contradictory in several spaces.

Humor often fell flat, the few really funny moments were all provided by Ryan Gosling's Ken.

Both Robbie and Gosling did great, but the script didn't give them enough to work with, imo.

The tone was also a huge issue for me. The movie seemed unsure whether it wanted to be scathing satire, silly goofiness or emotional inspiration and it honestly didn't succeed much at any of those.

I liked the concept for this movie but it didn't feel as if it went much beyond the concept.

1234,"I haven't been this confused since watching a movie since another Will Ferrell movie - Anchorman 2.

Questions I asked myself included general ""what is the message of this movie"" to ""did Barbie undergo any actual development?"" The movie sort of shows us these as well, Barbie is credited in-movie for things she says she never did. A movie where Barbie-world Barbie teaches real life Owner and Daughter to reconcile through her naive but empowered worldview would have a message to it. Multiple interpretations. But we didn't get that movie. A movie where real-world Evil Mattel tries to put Barbie ""back in the box"" as a metaphor for oppression would have very simple messaging, but we didn't get that movie. At every turn where this movie had a chance at messaging it replaced that chance with another joke. The messaging at the end, where Carla tells Barbie that Barbie's role is to continue changing and evolving and to continue to inspire women, and then she's like ""nah I'm good"". Barbie shows up in the real world and her first shown experience as a real woman is... that women have to go to gynecologists? It's a funny shocking joke - but what's the meaning? I'd say there is no meaning, but if you look for a meaning it's not a positive and inspiring one for women. 

Barbie's taking over Barbieland was rather shallow on the Barbie end. It's a movie where the Kens do the heavy lifting. And the character exploring. And the character growth. And I could see Barbie getting at the very least a nomination for Best Original Song. It might win it too! The song is that good and as far as anything pivotal in this movie goes it's the crux. But this is Barbie - so why are men at the focus?? Why is this movie carried by men? Barbie also happens to cry a lot. Sure - crying shows her having emotions instead of being a plastic doll. But crying? What's that say about women? Near the end she's constantly crying. And once again at the end Ken is the one who knows who he is - an extension of Barbie. And he emotionally struggles to change, with an emotional breakthrough. It's done much better than Barbie going to Heaven with a Ghost, crying, and not having a breakthrough. 

I don't know what to think. It felt a lot like Anchorman 2. That movie also had a chance to find a direction or make a point it pivoted to a joke. And it feels strange that a Barbie movie is so heavily carried by Gosling, Liu, and Ben-Adir. The Barbie's sneaky plan - and you know I love a heist movie - is also heavy on the male acting. The messaging of the movie is at odds with its own production.

I don't know what to think of it. The deprogramming by listing ways in which the world is unfair to women was something, but I don't think it went anywhere or did anything to resolve the issue. Or to even address it. And it's super strange to me that we found conflict and resolution in Barbie world - it's a movie that has no grounded experience for us as viewers. It's like when the Guardians of the Galaxy saved that random thing. Okay? I'm very well tired of ""save the world"" movies, but at least save our world people. Obviously it'd ring hollow if Barbie saved Earth from the patriarchy - as hollow as when Black Panther invested in inner cities and then Disney did jack shit to help inner cities in the real world - but it'd at least have some kind of message for Earth. 

I don't know. This is my rant. Time to read what everyone else wrote!

1235,"Super surprising how meta the movie was.  Didn't expect a ""mother f\*\*ker"" or ""beach each other off,""  or even the Space Odyssey reference. Super funny and was really for everyone. I was sitting next to like the stereotypical image of a rough and tough  'Merican country man and he was giggling throughout the whole thing.    


Only beef is that the transition to the gloves off ""alright let's address some things"" part of the movie was just super **BAM!**  I would have preferred a slower transition into it but then the movie would have to be super long.  I guess I'll just have to wait for the Snyder cut.

The guy who played Ken did a great job and worked well the guy who played Ken and the chemistry between them and the guy who played Ken just made a good trio.  I thought the guy who played Ken was a bit stiff but I'll blame the director for giving the guy who played Ken more lines than the guy who played Ken.

In the end, he only had one way to go, then, which was ‚ÄúI can be myself without Barbie‚Äù, but I wanted him to change into: ‚ÄúI can cry, I can be vulnerable, who cares about abs, I can do what I really love which is painting or whatever‚Äù. This would‚Äôve hit harder on why the patriarchy also hurts men. They did a great job hitting on why it hurts women but I wish it had that extra layer. That would‚Äôve made it more deep for me.

1240,"I'll come off the bat and just say that I had a lot of fun watching Barbie. Although Oppenheimer is the better of the two, Barbie made a better impression on me because of its tone, themes, and passionate cast. You could tell from the introduction that the film's entire cast and production team had an amazing time making this film. Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu are having the time of their lives filming their scenes, and they don't attempt to hide it either. 

As for Margot Robbie, Barbie cements her status as one of Hollywood's most gifted, modern-day character actresses. She is the life of this film and it's rather uncertain that anyone else could have elevated the starring role like she had. There are small scenes where she enhances the emotional impact of the circumstance her character is placed in. She will no doubt be seeing a number of nominations this fall and next winter.

Now, let's discuss the story. Barbie is about the title character going on a journey of self-discovery after experiencing a bout of unorthodox symptoms. Turns out, the girl who used to play with her is undergoing a midlife crisis. Now, it's up to Barbie and a stowaway Ken to make things right. 

The film presents its story in a linear fashion with two distinct POVs in Barbie and Ken. There is a lot of comedy and weird ""out of time"" moments both leads face, but the crux of the film is how both react to their experiences in the real world. Barbie develops an existential crisis when she realizes that her female-led utopia is actually molded by a board of men. Ken, who's being revolves around Barbie, is changed by the male hierarchical nature of the real world and he returns to Barbieland with his newfound ideology in hand. The film ends with a direct repudiation of the patriarchy that is conveyed through a speech and a proceeding music video set to a tune that's reminiscent of Queen's ""Bohemiam Rhapsody."" The story is enrapturing. Not one scene divests the audience from the film, especially when tensions ramp up. 

Greta Gerwig deserves as much adoration for this film as Margot Robbie. Her approach to this film is unique, fantastical, and heartfelt. The use of dance numbers contrasted against some emotional moments keeps the film afloat. One thing I appreciated that Gerwig did is the use of costume changes for the emo zoomer teenager, Sasha to convey the growing mother-daughter bond between Sasha and Gloria. The history lessons and easter eggs are nice too.

Overall, Barbie offers an exciting time in the theater. It's an excellent film that conveys a message of identity within a gender dominated society. Ryan and Simu are having a blast in this film, and the energy the cast gives off enhances the film. Margot and Greta are no doubt the heart and soul of this film, respectively, and they both succeed in making an enjoyable, fun film from a toy and its legacy. See this film at least twice.

My complaint, however, is they are too focused on the whole patriarchy concept in the dialog. I think the best stories/movies show not tell. I think there was more potential in showing how it affects women in some scenes rather than explicitly stating it repeatedly. I think that would have made the message stronger. Obviously, if they mentioned it a couple times that is not a problem, but halfway through the plot that's all they talk about.

If you don't think so, let me know! I don't know anything about making movies or writing them, so take this with a grain of salt! 

Overall, I think it was a fantastic movie!",2023-09-23 16:59:44,12,movies,IfIDontSeeYouAgain,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1249,"I really enjoyed the movie and found it absolutely hilarious - it was gratifying to see a world where roles were reversed (an escapist fantasy) and have that world be contrasted with the real world that is accurately depicted as one that can be uncomfortable and terrifying for women. I must add that I went into the movie without expecting a Barbie movie to teach me about feminism. If anything, it tackles the subject matter with breadth (matriarchy, patriarchy, toxic masculinity, empowerment) but not as much depth. And you know what? That's perfectly fine. The film was a visual treat, the actors really leaned into their campy roles (Margot was the Barbie we never knew we needed, America was so earnest, and Ryan was hilarious), and it was good fun overall.

If I were to be critical, I would pick on the characterisation and development of Gloria (though America did a FANTASTIC job).  Our introduction to Gloria >!is through these irrepressible thoughts of death that 'infect' Barbie!<. Yet, we never get a proper exploration of Gloria's>! mental state !<nor do we see how >!being in Barbieland helped Gloria psychologically!< (since the movie ends with Barbie's ending, not Gloria's). Had this been done, the monologue would have been even more impactful. After all, Gloria is the heart of the film as the key human character. I'm also not 100% sure why Gloria's >!drawing of Irrepressible Thoughts of Death Barbie (a new creation per se) impacted Stereotypical Barbie in the first place. Is it because Gloria, as a Mattel employee, was basing a new creation off an old model and causing changes to SB? In addition, are we meant to assume that Margot's SB only has a link to a single human being, i.e. Gloria? Given mass production, wouldn't it mean that Stereotypical Barbie is being played with by thousands of kids? Or is it that every version of SB has 1 human connection, and we're just looking at Margot's version of SB? Of course these weren't pressing questions but they did occur to me upon reflection!!<

That being said, I still absolutely loved it and would watch the film again in the cinemas if asked. I can imagine Barbie joining the ranks of Princess Diaries, Mean Girls and The Devil Wears Prada as pop culture favourites for time to come.",2023-07-24 18:32:29,12,movies,forestdewdrops,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1257,"I do think that the message of this movie is confusing.

For example, a lot of the discourse online discussing this movie isn't paying attention to the fact that the status quo set up at the start of the movie isn't supposed to be good.

Ken's line of 'Every night is boys night' is just cementing the fact that Barbie's treatment of the Ken's is wrong. But then at the end when it seems equality is reached one of the Barbie's completely undercuts it by saying the Ken's can have really low level jobs in the court or something, so Ken's are still second class citizens of Barbie land at the end?

So if this is an anti patriarchy message by showing that one gender ruling isn't right, then shouldn't it be an even playing field for both Ken's and Barbie's at the end? Or should we be taking away that it's okay to point out that the Patriarchy (or a matriarchy) is wrong, but it's fine to keep doing what's comfortable?",2023-07-23 10:32:25,12,movies,theCourtofJames,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

First off it's definitely not for kids, there was a lot of young kids in the cinema and I don't think they would have got most of the jokes or the story at all. Can't imagine how they feel.   
I thought there was a lot of great and funny moments in the story, the costumes and set designs are amazing and I loved the first half of the film and wished there was more set in that world.   
I felt the messages in the story were good but also very preachy and political. It was basically taking a character that is an icon and making an adult parody about it, which was not how it was marketed at all.   
I feel on the fence with this film because honestly there was a lot of good parts but also the messages felt forced or rushed. I'd still give this film a 3/5 because it was good and fun and emotional at times and the actors do a great job, but I wish it was less political and was more like the trailers advertised.",2023-07-23 06:29:22,12,movies,demonspaceviking,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
1261,"[HEAVY SPOILERS]


Overall really good, the message of how hard it is to be a woman was kind of beat to death, but I enjoyed how they still made it fun with that block hit hammer message going on as long as it did near the end of the movie. The female Barbies, barbies owner, the Executive board; they were all interesting to see.

Seeing Barbie have emotions for the first time, and have difficulty knowing what they were was refreshing. Since, in the beginning, everything was ""perfect"", a little too perfect if you ask me. Very goodüëçüëç

My favorite part was Ken singing ""Push"" and having an emotional breakdown because Barbie didn't want him. His constant smolder and his overall desire for Barbie to want him back was intriguing because we found out that his identity is tied to his relationship with Barbieü´£

 I like how, in the end, he and all the other Ken's realized that they are not extensions of Barbie; they are Ken. The way they made Barbieland more equal was amazing since they realized they didn't want to recreate the inequality of the Real World.

Very good, exciting movie. Ken's cringiness just made it better. Music was great, very funny

The costume and Set designs were amazing

Ryan Gosling KILLED it

There were admittedly some funny parts that made me laugh out loud, namely the ""Beach Off argument""


**The Bad:**

The Real World section of the movie was just cheesy

What was actually the point of Will Ferrell's character?

The scene when all the Ken's are playing for the barbie's was a fantastic scene and it was ruined by Barbie


**The Ugly:**

What was the plot supposed to be? It was fixing barbie, then it was destroying the patriarchy, then it was being human and finding yourself?

At the risk of sounding like an incel, they could've built women up instead of tearing men down. The message I got was, ""It's ok for people to be oppressed as long as women are in charge.""

If I had a nickel for everytime they said ""patriarchy,"" I could refund my ticket and buy myself some popcorn

1297,"The only good thing about the movie was- Ken?

I was really excited to see how Greta Gerwig, one of my favourite directors and writers, would tackle the concept of a live action movie. I absolutely loved her interpretation of the little women and lady bird is a gem of a movie (highly recommend). Since my expectations from the movie were so high, I came out of the theaters very disappointed. Here's why.

Overall the movie felt like someone had an idea of turning barbie into a live action movie and all the interesting details one can put into it. My problem really is that the writers couldn't come up with a cohesive plot to back the concept. The movie starts with a barbie world ruled by barbies, with Kens having no say at all. I think it's supposed to be something that contrasts the real world. We can clearly see the Kens struggling with their identities and purpose. However, instead of showing their struggle as a real issue, it is often used as a gag or a plot point that is supposed to show that the women are empowered or 'in-charge'. Ryan Gosling's Ken realizing that men rule the real world was not used as a motivation but a villain arc. Even by the end, the Kens' self realization was glossed over or used as a gag. They were pit against each other and the women used that to gain back the rule instead of coming to a mutual decision. How is this any different than patriarchy and I think this goes against the concept of feminism. Even at the end, the Kens were given token jobs in the cabinet. 

My other minor issues arise with the story. Firstly, Will Farrell's character was completely wasted. What was built up as a villain, ended up being another gag by the end. Every male character in the movie was shown to be dumb. That's not how the real world is. History has shown that people who have made an active effort to suppress women are not ""dumb"". They are shrewd but clever. Patriarchy and power has been institutionalized to an extent that they use all their wits and efforts to suppress women. I hate the fact that barbie had to do nothing clever in order to escape the people at Mattel.

Secondly, America Fererra's character's rant and support for Barbie wasn't developed well. One may argue her connection to Barbie was still someone explained, I would not go as far as to say it was developed but we got an explanation but her rant to de-brainwash the barbies came out of nowhere. There was one incident showed at the office. Her major character point was feeling disconnected with her daughter which did not tie into her rant at all. We weren't shown enough to experience her frustration. This led me to think that by the end the movie became more performative than feminist. 

Also, Alan, the only androgynous character who I think is supposed to be not straight but I'm not sure I apologize if I'm wrong but even if he were straight, doesn't fit into the stereotypical divide of man and woman is never given any respect, even till the very end like wtf this is not feminism.

Overall, the movie did not end up being cohesive, there was more tell than show and besides simu liu's and Ryan gosling's Ken, other characters who were played by big names, weren't campy and over the top enough. I have so much more to rant but I'm going to stop here.

Edit: I have a lot of points that I keep on adding because the more I think about it, the madder I get lol",2023-07-24 12:40:56,11,movies,Two-Appropriate,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1301,"Fun movie, the music, the humour, the vibe and directing were contagious. 



Kinda feel like it became too self righteous with the message and the final stretch of the movie lost track of itself. Like, it was trying to focus on all the issues women face today, and I mean ALL, speaking on a global level. And that kinda does a disservice to itself, since it simples the situation. The issues women face depend heavily on the area of the globe you are. Like a woman in North America has too worry about expectations from society and beauty standards, while someone from the middle east has to worry about legal rape and execution. 




I like the ambition, maybe focus on only one category? 





Barbie was a giant bitch at times and feels like she didn't have much growth by the end. I mean she's stereotypical Barbie at the beginning...but it doesn't feel like she became anything more by the end.",2023-07-31 00:16:13,11,movies,ThePerson_There,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1306,"I'm not the best at catching all the small tidbits in a movie, so I'd like some help if anyone can provide it. I am a man.

The speech from the Mother about what women deal with, and how it is used to de-program the Barbies took me out of the movie for the few minutes it was applied. Not because I don't understand societal pressures on women, but because I didn't catch how these pressures were displayed on the Mother, or even Barbie, on a societal level. I'm not connecting the dots between Barbie's issues where she's failing to be the toy she's meant to be and how we're suddenly on all the tiny social rules women have to follow, nor how those rules would fix the Barbies since they all live in a Utopia with none of those pressures.

Did the movie build up to that speech well? Was it just liked by everyone because they relate to it? Outside of that section, I enjoyed everything about the movie.",2023-07-23 02:25:58,11,movies,ILikeToJustReadHere,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1309,"For me it was... a meh story carried by everything else. The actors were fenomenal, the costume and stage designers nailed it and the dancers were a joy to watch on the big screen. But then comes a problem with the story I have not seen mentioned: it did not decide what it wanted to be. Too many mature and kinda flat jokes to be for kids of all ages, and an in-your-face feminist message that made it too much for those that wanted a light watch and not enough for those seeking an actual deep commentary on society. The only one left is to view it as satire and just roll with its nonsense when characters act based on plot (or joke) convenience if they even matter at all. If it just picked a side and developed that it would have been a lot better.

Power to those that got emotional and felt a deep conection to the characters but for me it did not, even when I really wanted to. So, given that art is subjective in its enjoyment, I think this is one of those movies that can only be graded individually by whoever watches it.

1311,"Hell No, this movie WASN'T male-bashing!

To me, at the end of the movie I got the message was there was Love and Respect towards men(Ken) by the Barbies in Barbieland. 


All women/Barbie wanted was that IF they are smart, powerful they deserve to be President, Doctor, Scientists, etc NOT saying men cannot be President,Doctor, etc as well...this movie NEVER implied this shit.

Where as the misogynistic men are afraid of a movie that send this message that females should have equal rights, want to control women. They can't stand this movie, because they don't want women to have have equal rights,  powers.

But again, I didn't get from this movie at all that there was hate towards men, the women want to be more powerful than men.

Not even in a ""afraid to really commit"" way like I assumed the reviewers were talking about, because if you're easily put in upset over this stuff, you're still likely to get upset, but it's more like it just says a whole lot and all that you can say is ""haha, fun-ee michael cera"". And then main barbie's story line in specific seemed very vaguely related to all of that in a way where i'm sure they're hoping analysts can cover for them. like if you took a kid to this movie, i don't even think they'd walk away with *any* message good or bad.

Fun film though, great humor from start to finish.",2023-07-23 08:05:52,11,movies,SomeMoreCows,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
1315,"The Barbie Marketing Team definitely deserves a HUGE raise.

Seriously, they did a FANTASTIC job. I went yesterday to see this movie, and from the trailers I was expecting a fun lighthearted comedy movie not taking itself seriously, that follows a similar concept to the Truman Show or the Lego movie. 

It truly subverted my expectations when the movie halfway through turned into a Vice article about toxic masculinity and patriarchy. I thought the whole patriarchy thing was gonna be some side joke about Ken misunderstanding it and doing some minor shenanigans in the backround until Barbie or someone explained it to him then it would be over. I didn't expect it to turn into the MAIN PLOT of the second half of the movie.

I didn't get how Ken even brainwashed the Barbies in the first place, but the scenes of the undoing the brainwashing was especially funny! Like how they were repeating stuff you hear on Twitter or one of those ban-friendly subreddits about toxic masculinity that Barbies shouldn't even know about. I liked the meta-joke where they undo the brainwashing on a Barbie and get her to remove her dress/skirt because ""she's a physicist, she would never wear this"". The joke being, of course, that the movie is trying to be so self aware it becomes unaware by imposing how a woman should dress, especially a Barbie of all.

Some people seemed to not like the ending, like how they solved things by turning the patriarchy back into a matriarchy and not giving the Kens equal rights, but those people don't understand the message. Barbie world is like a mirrored dimension of the real world, with roles switched (real world of course meaning USA), so Kens being as powerful as women in the real world makes sense. Sure, one may argue something like how real life society, history and politics are way more complex and oppression of women is especially gone in the western world legally and culturally, and the now self aware Barbies with no complex problems could at any point make their world equal, but you shouldn't listen to these kind of people.

I don't know why the other guy and 2 girls I went with said they didn't like the political messages and couldn't relate at all, I think the movie definitely absolutely needed those messaged and that they really, really fit a BARBIE movie.

Overall, I think this movie was great and a must watch and is worth a 7 or an 8 using the french grading system",2023-07-25 00:04:00,11,movies,CasualProfesionist,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
1316,"Aside from the visuals and some good jokes in there I didn't find it that entertaining. All of the characters are unlikeable. We can't feel sorry for Margot's pity party, The Kens war and songs go on too long, as does the Ruth Handler scene. Margot Robbie telling us she's no longer perfect now she has flat feet and cellulite really doesn't make the point the wanted it to make, even with the 4th wall break with narration gag, it still didn't land how I think they wanted it to. America's mono about the impossible task of being a perfect woman was great but used pretty mediocre examples and missed a great opportunity. Sasha's emotions throughout are at the whim of whatever point the writer is trying to make and don't follow the logic of actual human being. Gosling's character is really unlikeable, in a bad way. The hype of this movie and the marketing made me look forward to seeing Gosling as Ken only to extremely let me down. Not enough Barbieland or really any geography explored. Will Farrell and Co, are they good guys? Bad guys? I feel like they were meant to be bad but because they represent Mattel it was like, let's make them ridiculous to gloss over the fact they are also bad. What do you mean barbie doesn't need permission to be a human? Who are all these people in this randomly long drawn out flashback/flashforward? Allan's character was just massive wasted potential for someone interesting, they almost got there with him and then gave up, he was just a gag in the end.

Then there's the political messaging, which was the lowest on my list of complaints before anyone comes at me. Any time you may be starting to enjoy the movie, a soapbox moment appears and it's like you're watching a required training video rather than a movie which is supposed to entertain. Good storytelling is done through the story, this film has so much exposition it's insulting the intelligence of everyone who watches it.

Contrary to the many expectations set on women, I didn't need the Barbie movie to be anything except entertaining, but the writers completely forgot that entertainment can't be achieved by littering some jokes here and there, it's investment in good character background and arcs and storytelling. The main plot of I need to find this girl and repair the rift is completely abandoned because Ken brings patriarchy to Barbieland?

1318,"I liked how the Barbie‚Äôs completely failed to learn from the Ken‚Äôs revolution in their exclusion of the them from all major positions of influence and basically relegating them to second class citizens. The idea they were going for was to have Barbieland and the real world contrast each other, with a matriarchy in the former and a patriarchy in the latter which they then completely abandoned in the end. But even so much as banning the Ken‚Äôs completely from the Supreme Court when nearly half of the Supreme Court in the real world is comprised of women really shows how this film wanted to communicate female supremacy rather than truly creating an equal world for everyone. The film seemed intent on trying to spite men and convey the utopia of a female-led society while completely abandoning it‚Äôs initial premise and message of treating everyone equal. The film started off strong and at times I thought they were really drive the point home.  But this film was so clearly a bait and switch in order to advance the director‚Äôs clear radical feminist ideas.",2023-07-25 09:07:33,11,movies,eboezinger2,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1321,"The set and costume design was fantastic. It was visually fun to watch. I agree the story and message were all over the place. It was never fully established what caused Barbie‚Äôs 50% role in the rift, though it suggested it was maybe that she was only stereotypical Barbie, and perhaps, deep down that wasn‚Äôt enough for her. This was not made very clear, though, and this seems like a plot point rather than something that can remain ambiguous. Meanwhile, commentary on various aspects of society was HAMMERED into the audience through monologue and pithy aphorisms like ‚Äúmothers stand still so their daughters can look back‚Äù yada yada I still have no idea how that was relevant or what it means in the context of this Barbie movie. 

The other big issue is that Margot Robbie as Barbie out-acted every other character. She seemed more nuanced and human than even the human characters. Maybe this was purposeful? But it‚Äôs probably a lot of the reason why a lot of men got upset at the depiction of Kens and men as ridiculous. Truly, every single character in this film was ridiculous‚Ä¶ except for Barbie. She was the only one who acted out depth. That, and maybe the ghost of Handler? But to be honest, I don‚Äôt really understand the point of Handler as the creator of Barbie.

The start and end were great, though honestly I thought the midpoint in earth was quite meh, considering how fantastical barbieland was I thought they would have the real world, be, well, real but it was so unrealistic its insane.

Literally everyone they passed hit on them, the cops let them go twice for barbie being hot hitting on her and the cherry on top the company guy saying ""yeah patriarchy but keep it on the down low..."" None of it felt real at all, then they totally jumped the shark with mattel.

Lowest point of the movie for sure was the teenage daughter, her tangent was actually giving serious new velma vibes. Highest point for sure was the dance war.

Also found the line at the end didin't hit the same for me as it did others here ""maybe one day the kens here will have just as much power and influence as women have in the real world"" when it should been somthing like ""now the kens will have the same opertunities for power and influence as women in the real world.""

1338,"Literally just got home from seeing it so it's still all very fresh. I will say that I enjoyed it to a degree that outweighs any of the issues I had with it. The amount of care and detail that was put into every aspect of it is commendable and just off of that alone I think it counts as a job well done.

I think the worst possible thing they could have done with this film was left it in the hands of a person who didn't care about doing anything unique with it. There was a real opportunity here to make it into something original, surprising, and meaningful, and I think Gerwig, along with the whole cast and crew, really succeeded with that. And because it's a movie about a massive cultural icon like Barbie, it could have easily been sloppy and vapid and still made a lot of money and had people enjoying it, but they went the extra mile with it and made something of actual *value* too. I think I just walked out really appreciating its existence more than anything.

The main things I had issues with were the overall tone and meaning of the film. I found myself on a personal rollercoaster ride in terms of how it had me feeling from scene to scene. I just found it a little hard to get into the groove of it or something. I'm also not a person who enjoys things that are too ""on the nose"" in terms of messages being delivered in art. I just felt the movie could have benefited from being a little less self-aware  because it did kinda ruin the vibe of certain moments for me. It was an obvious reflection of the issues women face in our world, and I think that was a great choice and very appropriate. I just personally enjoy reading between the lines a bit more.

I also found that with how much was blatantly given to the audience in terms of the films message, I somehow walked away not really knowing what the message was??? Is it about the importance of equality or that women should run everything?? 

Anyway, it's still fresh and I think I could definitely benefit from another viewing of it. I also feel like all of its imperfections added a certain beauty to it as a whole and the fact that it's sparking so much discussion is maybe half the point.",2023-07-26 07:31:59,11,movies,Thisaintno_disco,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1348,"I liked this movie on the surface - it's cute, funny enough to have laugh moments throughout and altogether not too deep. I didn't go in to the cinema expecting it to be something totally amazing tbf. 

To start with there were a number of things that I felt were not very fleshed out;

- like the mother-daughter relationship which could have had more of an emotional aspect to the film instead of being very brief and forgettable.

-  America Ferrera's depression is also mentioned, but not delved into and why her issues affected Barbie so severely in Barbieland. They just go right over America's drawings having to do with death which sounded pretty dark.

- Unfortunately those things are just never developed once they all leave the real world - America Ferrera and Barbie are supposed to be just fine without totally addressing the depression and flat feet. America and her daughter also just end getting along fine with no explanation or anything to show why they did.
 
- Re. The teenage daughter, it's surprising she somehow comes round to the idea of stereotypical Barbie despite feeling the complete opposite for ""fascist"" Barbie just shortly before.

- And further the status of the Ken's at the end, still left without their own homes and still struggling since they are not totally 'equal' to the Barbies. 

üëÜ I would have enjoyed seeing Barbie staying in Barbieland to work on making the Barbies and Kens equal - but maybe that is what a sequel will be about. It would be interesting to see Barbie living in the real world learning to adjust to life as a real woman ""now having a vagina,"" whilst helping to make things equal in Barbieland.",2023-08-02 05:55:41,11,movies,lovelylonelyphantom,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
1349,"I think when presented it seems like a basic film- plot and a lot of underlying elements of social constructs. However, i think taking in account people‚Äôs reactions and the press- i‚Äôd say this movie hit everything it was trying to right on the nail. Yes Kens plot ends with him being ‚ÄúKenough‚Äù and finding his own place, which is more of a overall narrative to people that they don‚Äôt have to live off other people. However, all the stuff that was done prior to that in which some people are saying was ‚Äúwrong‚Äù for ken to feel/have happen was a great example of how females feel IRL! I mean ‚Äúomg a world where men aren‚Äôt appreciated?!?!‚Äù imagine how we feel. I think this movie hits a lot of point in clever ways that don‚Äôt always just involve the film but the outside reactions!! Not to mention the overall humor of being a girl and normalizing them in a funny way within the film!!",2023-08-02 14:27:52,11,movies,Electronic_Case4255,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1357,"(Spoiler alert). 
  
   
I don‚Äôt know why but I feel sad and disappointed that Barbie became a human at the end. That the whole movie was about saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre enough‚Äù but she didn‚Äôt feel perfect in the perfect utopia created just for her ‚Äî why would the real world be any better? 
  
And also it felt a bit meh like the whole Kendom thing was annoying and I wish it was more just a movie about Barbie discovering the real world (the ups and downs) and then having this crisis about which she wants to choose.   
    
I see some people missing some of the more subtle feminist takes like ‚Äúhurrr why after Ken cried they say the Ken‚Äôs can‚Äôt have a spot on the Supreme Court but only a minor role as a magistrate judge first!?‚Äù ‚Äî read up on feminist history pre 1950‚Äôs even (I know it was bad in the 50‚Äôs too and even now but I‚Äôm talking about before we could be independent of a husband like having a bank account, not being allowed certain careers etc and yes I know some  countries still have very restrictive practices for women please don‚Äôt pick at me for choosing an arbitrary decade!) that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs been for women ‚Äúno you can‚Äôt study medicine but you can become a nurse!‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay now women are doctors but you‚Äôre not going to be strong enough to become an ortho surgeon‚Ä¶ stick to dermatology, general practice and psychiatry‚Ä¶‚Äù (Also you hear comments like that even this day and age, some med specialties are still an old boys club).  
  
Margot Robbie is literally gorgeous and perfection ‚Äî can‚Äôt imagine a better Barbie.  
   
I worry for young children being taken, the message might be completely lost on them/too boring.  
   
A ‚ÄúBarbie discovering the real world‚Äù type movie would definitely have been able to appeal to kids with more kiddy jokes and adults with some more subtle jokes.. I‚Äôm imagining a lot of funny ‚Äútoilet humour‚Äù scenes, coughing her plastic lungs out on a bong or something lol but I‚Äôm sure Mattel had a lottttt of strict rules in the way their product could be portrayed which might also explain some peoples questions regarding the script. 
  
Btw for what it‚Äôs worth I‚Äôm a late 20‚Äôs female (just so I don‚Äôt get any incel comments etc for not being amazingly blown away by the film like I  was so excited and pumped for and hoping to be.   
  
Also I‚Äôm sad there will be no more promo being done now it‚Äôs released (duh) because Margot‚Äôs stylist was absolutely killing if with all vintage Barbie outfits he had her in.  
  
Also is just me or were most of the jokes in the trailer? Or made to feel more important than they really were like the choreographed dance to Dua‚Äôs song like I thought we would get to see way more ‚Äúall the Barbies dancing!‚Äù scenes.  
  
Lastly: I know most people ‚Äî myself included ‚Äî have enjoyed some new original cinema being made and not just a Something Something Movie The Third being made (except Shrek all those movies smash) but would anyone else be keen for a Barbie 2 where maybe she does live in the real world, experiences it all (crazy night club scenes, boring job scenes, The Joys of Having Genitals scenes, living with Sachs‚Äôs family, experiencing love/grief/anger/happiness as she goes along whatever and then deciding she wants to go back to being a Barbie? Idk shy it‚Äôs bothered me so much she‚Äôs become a human?",2023-07-28 18:33:38,11,movies,Hamburgo,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
1358,"After seeing Barbie, which I liked well enough, I KNOW there will be a sequel and frankly I think they should flip it and explore the male/boy side of things with G.I. Joe and how guys (or rather me and my brothers) played with toys buy burying them in the mud, drowning them in water, blowing up the enemies. And also explore how those stereotypes effected us.

It would be really interesting to see Barbie enter another realm of toys different to the one she ""grew up in"". And examine how boys and girls handle things playing together and apart.

And it starts with the whole concept that boys toys are called action figures and Barbie is a ""doll"". And how barbie (and the dolls) have many roles but but with G.I. Joe there and most other action figures there only two roles either hero or villain. There is no lawyer G.I. Joe or teacher, or dancer, or painter or chef etc. Just army dudes who are good or bad.",2023-08-01 19:56:58,11,movies,pjdance,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
1359,"I get the core message, but I struggled to find myself enjoying the movie because the story was so much ""and then this happens, and then this happens, and then this happens"" and so much pointless fluff. I just found myself asking ""why is this even happening"" half the time.

Like what was the point of Allen kicking the shit out of the Kens to escape, only for them to go back to Barbieland and for Allen to never leave? What about the old woman whom Barbie complimented for being beautiful? I thought that was going to lead to going back to something else(maybe her deciding to become human?), but it just happened. Barbie complimented an old lady. Sweet, but why? I know the Scooby-Doo chase scene in the Mattel building was played up for laughs, but it felt like we could've spent a couple minutes doing something else, perhaps expanding on the relationship with the mother and daughter. Also, why was there a dragging scene of the kens fighting and then doing a dance number about how ken they are? That scene just went on and on and on and it was driving me crazy. 

It was an okay movie. I think, however, with the brand they had and the message they were trying to convey, it could have been portrayed or maybe better. 

That being said, costume and set design, plus the actors cast, were near perfect. There were some jokes that got a chuckle out of me. The 4th wall Margot Robbie actress breaking made me laugh, and ""I am Kenough"" was awesome. Every time Weird Barbie was on screen, I was chortling, and speaking of characters... I do feel the mothers speech about women in the 3rd act and the message was very impactful.

Then again, I wish they just give the Kens their dream Wild West world! they don't even seem to have houses, of course, don't have them take over Barbieland, but why not have their own section? honsetly, I would love if they actully make a wild west toy line of the Kens, and finally give Ken the horse we want (Obviusly he don't want to be a ruler, he want to be a cowboy!) and his own dream Wild West Casa-Dogo-House! it mean, it's basicly free money!",2023-07-24 07:43:13,10,movies,Math383838,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1369,"i really loved this movie despite the flaws in the plot. 

what i loved about this movie: the set and costume design was perfect. barbie land was magical, the pink was amazing. margot robbie, imo, was the perfect stereotypical barbie (and absolutely stunning). ryan gosling was truly amazing as ken, he was the funniest part of the movie. he leaned into the patriarchy jokes so well, he did it in such a way that had an undertone of sarcasm which made me feel through the screen like gosling knew how ridiculous his character was (if that makes any sense?). i loved the inclusion of ruth. and overall, i loved the feminism of this movie. 

what i didn‚Äôt love about this movie: no offense, but i thought america ferrera and whoever played her daughter were the weakest part of this movie. their acting was not great and was kind of corny imo, and their writing/storyline wasn‚Äôt even great either. i understood the overall message but i thought the plot was just messy at some points. it felt like no one really had a purpose, it was just barbie suddenly realizing she wanted to become human. i really really wanted to like the monologue and the montage of women at the end, but i felt like it wasn‚Äôt explained/written very well so it lost it‚Äôs emotional impact. 

overall, i‚Äôm forgiving the at times messy plot because of the way the movie made me feel, the happiness i felt in barbieland, the nostalgia, and the acting from margot and ryan.",2023-07-22 23:47:43,10,movies,ham_alamadingdong,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
1370,"One of the underlying concepts of the storyline in this movie was cool. I found that there were a lot of similarities with the Matrix where Barbie gets essentially unplugged from a perfect world and chooses to live a life in the real world.

I wished that the depiction of the real world in this movie was more realistic. The polarization of the conceptually perfect world and reality would have been better pronounced which I think would've been cool

The scenes where Barbie becomes more human were really wholesome and emotional, I loved that!

1371,"Fun movie. I didn't like any of the Mattel stuff. Will Ferrell isn't funny and literally does nothing for the whole movie. He exists just to take up screen time. If his scenes were cut then we could have had more time of Ken and Barbie exploring the real world. They both make the switch just a little too quickly. Performances are great. Design is great. Dance scenes and songs were great but too few.

One complaint is how several of the jokes were spoiled by some of the trailers and by the narrator during the movie. Did we really need to be told that Barbie floats because it's like if a kid were picking her up? Would the audience have been able to infer that from a gag?",2023-07-21 15:18:56,10,movies,Videomiso,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1375,"In addition to the metaphor of Kens being treated in Barbieland how women are treated in the real world, I think that it‚Äôs interesting to note that the patriarchy/misogyny shames boys for playing with dolls/Barbies. The Kens are underdeveloped because for so long and even still now, boys were told Barbies and dolls were ‚Äúgirl toys‚Äù‚Ä¶From who I‚Äôve interacted with, the people who miss the metaphor are the same ones who are telling their little boys not to play with dolls, ironically making them the reason Kens are treated like that in Barbieland.

I think the Kens taking over is also very symbolic of growing up in society as a girl. You grow up with your friends‚Äî guys and girls‚Äî and someday the boys you loved turn into misogynistic men. Like when did you start hating me? Why? And no, not ALL guys. Alan (slay King) is representative of the guys who stand by us even when things get rough.

1384,"I liked Barbie but surprisingly the crowd full of mostly women didn't seem to like it as much as me. I was laughing more than them. The part where America Ferrera gives a long monologue about how ""Women can't be this but gotta be that, too this but too that"". All I heard was a woman behind me sigh.  That monologue seemed to just pause the entire movie and be like ""ok just incase the audience doesn't understand what we are trying to say, we will have a character explain it to the audience as if they don't already know"". 

Even though I still enjoyed it, there were just so many moments that felt a little over-the-top. Like when some guy on Malibu beach slaps Barbie's ass and then she defends herself and her and Ken go to jail. Only to be followed by 2 cops sexualizing Barbie in the most unrealistic way. It's parts like that which make the movie just not as good as it could have been. That scene in jail was only there to have 2 cops comment on how hot Barbie is, it's not even a joke or anything so it just seems pointless besides ""Aren't men pigs?"" 

So while I did like the movie, it is definitely full of so many poorly landed jokes which felt almost awkward in an almost full theater with 80% women. I expected the entire crowd to applaud at the end, but when ""Barbie"" title popped up at the end, only 1 lady clapped.",2023-07-25 22:23:27,10,movies,MarkHAZE86,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1386,"Just saw it. It was about what I expected, and I enjoyed it. Barbieland was quite the set piece, and the integration of various Barbie products felt seamless and natural. I especially liked the film's score, especially while they were in Barbieland and how the music sort of responded to whatever was happening, even in the lyrics. The costume design felt very on-brand. I adored the characters' over-the-top personalities and acting, especially on the Kens. The lead Ken was a pleasure to watch. Stereotypical Barbie was likewise the right amount of melodrama and radiance for the character, though appropriately geared more towards drama than some of the wackier elements of the film. 

My only sticking point was Mattel's depiction and its board of directors. I suppose no director or writer could get away with making them look explicitly *bad* per se, (can you get away with making a movie about an existing IP while simultaneously villainizing their parent company? I'm skeptical.) so the CEO ultimately had to at least present himself as redeemable, and Will Ferrell was very par for the course in this role.",2023-09-24 04:32:49,10,movies,Foxxyedarko,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1391,"This movie is overly theory crafted I swear. It is just a movie about two individuals having existential crisis where one is breaking from their pattern of complacency while the other is seeking their purpose in life. In the end, Barbie broke away from her utopic environment and embraced her humanity, while Ken stayed in Barbieland and acknowledged that his existence is not tied to another individual; that he is Ken-ough.

No, Barbieland and Kendom are not representatives of real life feminism and patriarchy else we would have seen a lot of gossiping, backstabbing, territorial disputes, and fighting over ""limited"" resources as we know that real humans will destroy each other given the chance. 

So what is the moral of the story? Definitely not ""patriarchy bad, feminism good"" because even Ken acknowledged that he did not fully understand patriarchy and Barbie chose to live in the patriarchy of the real world. At most, the lesson would be ""our system is broken, but it is a system"" and ""love your mother"".

1399,"This film is borderline a masterpiece because it's just really clever. It never really talks down to it's audience and it is laugh out loud funny.

The film honestly feels like a headfuck though because it makes you question your position in the world. The cast was great, Robbie really showed her chops in parts of vulnerability that could be felt and Gosling was a powerhouse. Robbie is so likable as this character, she was honestly a delight.

The creative crew and Gerwig did an EXCEPTIONAL job, please look at the creative process it was a delight to watch.

1406,"I will preface this by saying that I am a guy and I chose to watch this movie by myself because I was that excited to see it. I‚Äôve never played with Barbies, dolls, or any sort of action figures. This wasn‚Äôt a toy movie for me, just a regular movie. If you don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm the target demographic for this movie, shame on you. I don‚Äôt see movies as gendered, and if you do, I‚Äôm sorry you limit yourself like that. 

I‚Äôm mixed. The comedy and plot were generally great, and everyone gave good performances (weirdly it was Ryan Gosling who stood out), the directing, set pieces, music choices, all of it good, but I did not like the themes.

This movie is rated PG 13, but a lot of kids with their parents came to see it, and I feel like they‚Äôre going to walk away from the theatre with some wrong ideas. This movie kind of presented the idea of Barbieland, aka a matriarchy, being so much better than the real world, a patriarchy. They‚Äôre both bad things. The movie took on an adult theme and problem, but gave a very childish view of it. The Barbies seriously were that engrossed with the patriarchy they needed a rousing speech and social media feminism to make them snap out of it? What the hell? 

In Barbieland they presented both the matriarchy and the patriarchy as this good thing as long as the ‚Äúunderclass‚Äù don‚Äôt realize that there‚Äôs another option. In the real world we know about these issues. It doesn‚Äôt take an awakening to realize that certain groups have more power, and there is no blissful ignorance. Being the wrong crowd means you get hurt. 

And the ending pretty much reverted Barbieland (an idea of a better society) back to where it was? Oh, one Ken will have an important position from time to time, and maybe some small amount of improvement in the future. I do realize that the real world is heavily favored with men in power. The Mattel chairman characters more subtly presented that idea better than any other part of the movie.

Ultimately, I think this movie presented themes creeping towards toxic femininity. Take the example of the dad, a gringo unable to go outside, thus causing the mother to be deeply unhappy. That idea is so sexist. A man has an issue, and because of that the woman is in anguish. Do women not have agency and control to determine their own well being? Also that dad was practicing Spanish on his own to better connect with his Latina family and they gave him some shit for it, which I don‚Äôt appreciate. They also blamed a lot of problems on men that women perpetuate. Women physical beauty standards are almost entirely dictated by other women, even shown in the film. Not once did a single male character (as far as I can remember, could be wrong) comment about the way a woman looked, outside of those very in your face construction workers and beach goers. The Barbies and other women constantly commented about each other‚Äôs appearances, and even isolated Kate McKinnon‚Äôs Barbie and called her ugly/weird several times. You can‚Äôt have your cake and eat it too.

All this to say, I did enjoy the movie, but I have to separate some of the themes with the rest of the film. Definitely rewatchable, and I may change my opinion about it, who knows.",2023-07-23 07:56:41,10,movies,jklmcc56,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1412,"I watched barbie today and I have a lot of feelings about it and I'm unsure as to whether I even enjoyed it or not but that's a separate issue.

In regards to ken, is his lack of character development (to a degree) meant to be a reflection of women's portrayal in the media? With one dimensional relationship based identities being a prominent trope of female characters. I am right in thinking that? or was it simply just meant to be playing into the stupidity of patriarchy... if so is that not hypocritical, in the sense that a society run by  ""one dimensional women""  would not make a good society or is that the point. 

Also re: ken, the placement although very funny of 'I'm just ken' felt like it was in the wrong place? Should it not have happened after the initial refusal from barbie? As opposed to after the destruction of barbie land, like it doesn't make sense to me that singing a song about being enough after ruining the society the barbie's had made that was although not necessarily equal but functional to a degree to it's main patrons, the barbies (Ultimately a children's toy, a matriarchal society makes sense if it's aimed at women) anyway why do they arrive at self realisation post destruction, would it not made more sense to have that song before Kendom was brought to life? like ken realises he's enough and then takes charge? this understandably would throw out the whole time line of the movie in regards to the real world visit. Please any opinions or thoughts are welcome.

Like any great film with such a build up, something is just niggling at me, and I'm not saying I am disappointed at the end result of the film but it does leave me with more questions than answers and plot points that didn't seem to come to a conclusion.

On the plus side, the portrayals of women's trials and tribulates and America's monologue were phenomenal. The symbolism of barbies interaction with the old lady on the bench and just overall emotional journey I went on throughout the film was pure awe. I have not watched a film for a while that made me emotionally ache the way this one has. 

Perhaps that in itself is self explanatory and something that has only just click now, and it's silly for me to even mention this if it's abundantly obvious to everyone else.

1414,"So comments on here are confusing me a little.

I thought the Kens represented men in the real world that are waking up to realizing what patriarchy has done to them. And the reason they wouldn't allow men on the supreme court in Barbie Land was because the Kens didn't embrace patriarchal institutions, i.e. college degrees, mentioned a few times. And they started to reject patriarchy by the end of the Ken War, and then fully rejected it by the end of the movie. Barbie Land, run by the real world patriarchy and so it mirrors the real world in it's patriarchal institutions, isn't there yet and that's the reason the Kens can't be on the supreme court.

Some comments on this thread though are saying the Kens represented women in the real world. Which would then make the Barbies represent the men and the patriarchy? So, in the end, the patriarchy wins but it's starting to fail as the Kens (women) and Barbies (men) become more aware of themselves?

On this point, what role the Kens are playing, I thought I had it but now I'm not so sure...",2023-07-24 00:16:21,10,movies,kappachow,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1417,"The easiest way I can describe this movie is with 2 words: Wasted potential.

I am easily in the opposite camp of whatever group this movie was trying to appeal to. I didn't want to watch what I assumed was going to be a dumb bimbo movie. (Un)fortunately I was dragged to this by a friend so I went in and tried to enjoy the movie.

And honestly I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought. It was a somewhat smarter movie than I initially thought and the camp was if not mediocre then at least adequate. The production was insane even though most of it was filmed in a pink hellscape. The actors put up a hell of a job and did their best. If I think of this as a movie, then it's pretty decent.

Except its not trying to be a movie for the sake of it. It wants to be smart and intellectual. It wants you to think about what you saw and reflect on it. The problem is, it is all over the place in what it wants to say. It wants to empower women but has to do in the most tell don't show way that it turned right around to preachy and cringey. It tries to show Barbie joining the human world as a big deal but the movie just shows that she had a horrible time in the human world, which just makes Barbie look dumb. Speaking of the human world, it takes up substantially less time than one would think, which honestly makes me wonder if parts of this movie were cut for time. 

Thing is, I do think if this movie were longer, more could be done with the messaging and storytelling. But also I am glad it wasn't longer because by the end when they just revert everything back to normal and Barbie goes to the human world, I find myself asking what was the point of all that? Worse, as a guy, I feel like I've just been told off for crimes other guys have done to girls. If they had just tried to focus on something rather than try to cover everything from female to individual empowerment to why the patriarchy is bad, this honestly could have been a great film. As it stands, it's a frustrating movie that wants to be everything when it doesn't know everything and which thinks it's smarter than it is.",2023-08-15 10:10:14,10,movies,RWBYSanctum,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1422,"I like how stereotypical Barbie is an analogy for how to reflect on life.

She starts out living life tiptoeing all the time, with everything appearing to be perfect. And it does appear so because she conforms to societal expectations on what stereotypical Barbie is supposed to be. She's supposed to be what the normal or average Joe is.

And this is of course, very tiring.

While partying she suddenly becomes conscious of death. Just like how the average person occasionally becomes aware of their mortality, they are forced to make a choice - whether to brush it aside as a joke (which Barbie did and the rest accepted it), or to act on this realization.

But knowing this changes Barbie (as all people who reflect on Death are changed by it). She notices her blemishes. She no longer can live life tiptoeing all the time like everyone else. She cannot go back to living life as stereotypical Barbie.

She then meets weird Barbie who is often criticized for being weird - and she is very different from all the Barbies. She does not conform, has her own views, and is not trapped by societal expectations - the exact opposite of stereotypical Barbie. But Barbie is only here because she has no choice. Weird Barbie gives her a ""choice"" to help her feel better - but she just wants to forget having a choice and live in Barbie land perfectly forever and ever. Barbie obviously chooses to want to remain ignorant, but that doesn't work because she actually has to go to the real world. But this is the start of her self actualization - actually confronting the real world.

She then has a complete breakdown over being torn apart by Sasha. And then she meets her creator when confronted by her feelings of self doubt as to whether she is enough. Eventually even her Dreamland is torn apart by Ken, for whom shatters her ideal homeland that she loves so much. She is forced to face reality and fight to preserve what is precious for her. And she succeeds - turning the patriarchy on itself (in an admittedly simple way) but pokes fun on what the conventional patriarchy is.

When her homeland is finally restored - breaking the Barbies free of the brainwashing and allowing them to restore the ideal world to what they think it should be - she has a choice. She is changed entirely from the experience she had in the real world, and she can choose to continue living in Barbie world (a Dreamland where everything is ""perfect"" and there is nothing she needs to think about) or go to the real world (where everything is confusing, imperfect, filled with change and difficult to navigate).

And of course, Barbie being changed, can no longer go back to being just a ""stereotypical Barbie"". She wants to know whether she can Be, or know her purpose - for which her creator says she wasn't designed with purpose because her ending isn't written - but instead warns her that to take the next step is to be irrevocably changed.

And the way to that change is to close her eyes and Feel. She literally becomes aware, and for the first time she Breathes. It is an analogy that for ourselves to become aware and to start to live life, is to bring ourselves to feel, and be aware of our very breath, the one change that allows us to continue living from moment to moment. She becomes alive for the first time, and chooses to accept everything that comes with it, with the changes and difficulty it brings.

She no longer lives in Barbie world, and the bridge between both worlds is sealed forever. And the very first thing she does is to accept and live - with some fear and trepidation, while being supported by her real world ""family"" - as a woman, by seeing a gynaecologist. Perhaps it was intended to be a final joke since Barbies don't have vaginas, and needs to settle that aspect to live in the real world, but to me it appeared to be accepting and embracing a fundamental aspect of herself - that despite having always been a woman by design as a doll, actively embracing that identity and owning it is another thing altogether. She actively chooses who she is.

And to embrace who you are is when you truly begin to live. Whether you choose to go to the real world (like Barbie did), or let things go back to how they normally are (Ken is Kenough).

Perhaps as a commentary on various things it is shallow. It pokes fun at itself from time to time and doesn't shame people for choosing to live in the Dreamworld (eg. When Sasha's mom actively embraces Barbie and her quirky side and snaps back at Sasha saying that she just wants to be happy for once). In that aspect it is quite ""real"" to me in that these are very human responses.

But to me, I appreciate the message that no matter how stereotypical each of us may be, we always have the capacity to reflect and choose differently, and in so doing truly live life.",2023-08-06 15:03:26,10,movies,OnyxSeaDragon,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

I would have liked to see more real world interactions and I‚Äôm not sure why they made Will Ferral character mentally challenged. But overall it was great. 9/10

I also think people are taking this movie way to seriously and framing it as some gospel for feminism and young women etc. This film was a satire about gender roles in society and have could easily been an SNL skit that was rated R.

1447,"The movie was entertaining and funny, but the story and message was pretty bland. The main Ken was treated like a prop while living in Barbieland and gets his only validation from Barbie, his frustration were valid. There didn't seem to be a place for Kens in Barbieland other than to be accessories to their respective Barbies. Then Kens and the patriarchy became the antagonists of the story, rather than the unfair treatment of genders in both Barbieland and the real world.

My main problem with the movie was honestly the plot. The comedy was great, but the plot was just eh. It would have been better if the main Barbie decided she wanted to become human and Gloria wanted to become Barbie.

Edit: The resolution could have been if things were changed around.

1448,"The comedy fell flat most of the time. Will Ferrell and the Matell guys especially.

I get what they wanted to do and it was a decent film but felt kind of rushed when they only spent like 30 minutes in the real world.

Gerwig got her feminism through but without the stereotypical ‚Äùgirlboss with an attitude‚Äù. It was done in a nice way and they even uplifted the Kens in a way.

Michael Cera had a smaller role than I expected.

Margot Robbie was good but man she is the prettiest person alive.

Ryan Gosling was easily the best part of the movie.",2023-07-22 07:46:39,10,movies,Accurate_Bed1021,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

However, it seemed like the whole film was in Barbie land with it barely showing Ken and Barbie in Real World. I really felt like they could have let Ryan shine in the real world with more masculine men humor, and Margo have more time being in a mans world.

What makes me want to give this movie a 5 or a 6 is more like when I think about how other relatively mundane kids plaything movies developed vast and complex worlds and compelling plots.  Like I'm old enough to remember thinking it was the stupidest move possible for Hollywood to make a movie out of a Disneyland Ride. Or Legos. Or even the board game *Battleship*. And they're simply not even in the same league as Barbie they're so far advanced.   It's like the ultimate thing about this movie is that feminism is pretty boring, almost like this was a religious movie telling us nothing new about worn out tropes.  In terms of kids plaything exploitation movies I'd put Barbie at about the same level as *The Transformers* movies.

The film really went beyond what you would expect and wove together a narrative about identity and finding your place in the world beyond what is foisted upon you due to your gender role. It really shows that everyone struggles with issues of identity because of the expectations that we all have to deal with.

A lot of the humour in the film overall just felt like ""Oh yeah I get it!"" internet reference type humour rather than genuinely hilarious shit.

1477,"There are so many parallels between the Barbie movie and The Matrix movies

Barbie is actually Neo.

There were other characters that are an homage to Morpheus, The Oracle, Agent Smith, Cypher, the Architect, just to name a few. 

I think particularly one scene that stuck out the most from the Matrix was when the oracle points to a sign hanging on the wall that reads ‚Äúknow thyself‚Äù in latin and much of the Barbie movie seems to center around this theme. 

There have been many iterations of the Matrix as we know from the conversation between Neo and the Architect. 

The first Matrix designed by the Architect was perfect but it‚Äôs doom was inevitable (just like the first iteration of barbieland). Barbie inevitably becomes depressed Barbie and the whole world comes crashing down.

The second Matrix was based off human history to accurately depict human nature, rife human hubris (the proposed Ken-land). Which also fails.

The answer to a subsequent matrix was ‚Äústumbled upon by another, a more intuitive program‚Ä¶ to investigate aspects of the human psyche‚Äù where the subjects in the matrix accepted the matrix if they were given a choice.

1480,"Actually, it isn‚Äôt the case that before Barbie little girls played only with baby dolls.  The Vogue doll company sold a family of small dolls including the famous Ginny doll (she was about 7 years old); Ginny‚Äôs baby sister, Ginette; Ginny‚Äôs older sister, Jill (a teenager); Jill‚Äôs best friend, Jan; and Jill‚Äôs brother, Jeff.  Jill, Jan, and Jeff had adult bodies, although, of course, they lacked genitals.  Jill and Jeff were billed as brother and sister (hence, not dating), and it was sometimes hinted that Jan was Jeff‚Äôs girlfriend (his prom date).  

The Vogue dolls, and, in particular, the Ginny doll, had beautiful outfits made with attention to detail.  

There was also a beautiful miniature adult doll manufactured by the Ideal company called the Revlon doll.  She also came with a brassiere and panty girdle, and she also had nylon hose.  She was essentially a fashion doll, having the look of a well-dressed young woman of the 1950s.  Many of the garments made for her were beautifully sewn.  I think also that the Revlon doll may have also come in a larger version.  The miniature doll may have been a prototype for the larger doll.  

My aunt gave me a Revlon doll when I was about eight years old.  My friend had a Jill doll and, I think, a Jeff doll, too.  There was no such doll as the Barbie doll at that time.  I think that Barbie was first developed in 1959.  

Most dolls at that time were larger than the Barbie doll; for example, a baby doll could be the size of a real baby.

1496,"I'm a 33 year old Ken and I think I'm gonna go see it again in a few days. It was just... real good, for everyone. Funny, beautifully shot, with motivation messages for girls and boys (which I didn't expect to be honest), unexpected plot, character development. It was light and a bit goofy in a good way, like even the 'real world' felt a bit cartoonish/dolly, but again it wasn't stupid and out of place.

Audience really loved it and I just left with this warm feeling afterwards. It's just really good. Again, I thought it's going to be a truman show with a message about girl power, but it's actually way more than that. Will Ferrel is great, MR is great, but Gosling really steals the show and for me Ken had the best arc.

Oh by the way it's not for kids. There's nothing bad or adult, but it's not a kids' movie (because we had a lot of kids in the screening and they were definitely bored).

That said, people are complaining about how the Ken's are treated as an underclass, and while it can be seen that way, I thought it was a play on the bimbo stereotype and how women were portrayed in old-school films, for example the James Bond movies where Sean Connery would tell a woman to go away because it's time for ""man talk"" and then slap her ass as she was walked away.",2023-07-23 01:01:52,9,movies,Moonagi,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1507,"Just saw the movie and I loved it! Even though it might not have felt very nuanced if you make your own perspective on the film it can give a very powerful message. Women are still held down by the patriarchy and faced with struggles everyday, but we continue to live and find love in our surroundings even with that pain. The reaction to the movie proves that things that are geared towards a more female perspective are still strongly misunderstood and undervalued. 
 I also liked Ken‚Äôs story I feel like a lot of people are underestimating it. Ken was a victim of the patriarchy even though he didn‚Äôt realize it like a lot of modern men. I feel like it can tie to how men who are trying to understand what the patriarchy is  can take it to mean that they‚Äôre supposed to have some extreme amount of advantages over women and that it means their lives are supposed to be perfect. So they don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs real because their lives aren‚Äôt perfect. Now he believed it but he believed that it should make him all powerful. He wasn‚Äôt talented at anything that made him important and he was angry that Barbie didn‚Äôt love him the way he loved her and thought the patriarchy would fix it. He only felt valued when a woman loved him or when he was important, like modern men he uses hyper masculinity when that‚Äôs having the opposite effect. He doesn‚Äôt try to understand his feelings and value himself as an individual. It just shows how toxic masculinity or the patriarchy hurt both parties not just women. Not only that but Ken is used as a mirror about how most women are treated in other media an accessory. Overall it can be a very introspective film if you choose to look at it closely.

1510,"Just saw Barbie. As a movie it was good. Ryan Gosling was acting his heart out. Lots of good humour bits. Set design and outfits were very well done.

Its politics are iffy. I'm not saying it was 'woke' propaganda as idiot right-wingers are, who are purely reacting against surface-level characteristics of the movie. It just doesn't seem very well thought out or is really uneven and weird.

Yes, I'm talking about the Kens. A lot of people have outlined that the triumph of the movie is a reactionary counter-coup that puts the repressed underclass back in its place, with at best minor symbolic concessions.

The message about Ken is that despite legitimate grievances about society as a whole, actually, the problem is with him and he needs to mentally self-reflect and accept his place. Which is actually a very conservative mentality, Jordan Peterson literally has a talking point that you can't complain about issues with broad society, if your own life isn't fixed.

Yeah, it is mixed with a message about being 'entitled' to a woman, which makes it messy.

Other things I noticed was that while there was a very noticeable plus-sized Barbie and a wheelchair Barbie, that all the Ken's are either muscular or skinny. They all are under a 'Barbie Gaze' which goes completely unremarked on. And an audience gaze, since I could hear some women in the audience when Ryan Gosling was on screen.

The message about feminism is also really messy and limited. I saw someone call it upper middle-class feminism. If you listen to America Ferrera's rants to the Barbie's it's just about social expectations. Which is something that everybody deals with, male or female. I as a man have to deal with trying to manage to try not to scare people or talk over them, or be creepy. It's a very self-centred view to pretend that only the social expectations that impact you are bad and ignore that everybody else has them. The movie makes a point about body positivity by including plus-sized Barbie and Wheelchair Barbie and centring them in scenes. It just seems like the charge often lobbied at the body positivity movement that it's only for women, and not for men the way it's presented.

But nothing about you know material issues, like pay gaps, reproductive and other women health issues, poverty of elderly women, violence, etc. Women can't control their reproductive health in half the country Barbie is set in, and it isn't remarked on.

And at the end of the day, Ken is going back to sleeping on the beach, for all the self-actualisation that he has done. 

I mean her ranting about real-life issues should also go over their heads. They have no real frame of reference for it.

Also, the movie devotes much screen time to lampooning toxic masculinity. Like Ken's earnestly trying to explain things to Barbie who asked them. But the movie starts with Barbies playing with Ken's feelings and not caring about them as anything but accessories. And then solves the Ken problem by ... playing with Ken's feelings and putting them back as accessories with a minor concession. Toxic feminity which also goes unremarked on.

A feminism that is purely about lifting social expectations on women, while reinforcing social expectations on men is going to be alienating. Both to women who do have real material concerns in their life enforced on them by wider society. And to men who feel trapped and confused by contradictory social expectations and general social atomisation.

Maybe I'm just overthinking this. But I saw so much praise for this as a deep movie with an important message, and it just felt shallow.",2023-08-06 11:01:55,9,movies,AussieHawker,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1528,"Full confession. I was a huge Barbie girl as a little one so definitely was not in the ‚Äúif you hate Barbie this movie is for you‚Äù category so bear that in mind.

I have to say it. I didn‚Äôt like this movie and it really upsets me because I wanted to and was super duper hyped for it (yes I wore pink and even took a Barbie).
For me, and I‚Äôm sorry perhaps I‚Äôm dumb and I just didn‚Äôt get a lot of it, but it really fell flat once they left Barbie land. I didn‚Äôt feel like the Barbie character was fun and goofy enough like I imagined she would be and her being sad and not wanting to be a Barbie was sad to me. I would have preferred the ending to be her coming to terms with being a hero to little girls and embracing that and then trying to change Barbie land to be more equal with Ken.

Also even though Ken discovering the patriarchy and his Mojo Dojo house was really fun and probably the most entertaining part of the movie after the first half hour, I don‚Äôt really like the messaging that Barbie and Ken (as they kind of represent men and women in this movie) can‚Äôt work together and get along. I did have a Ken and no I didn‚Äôt play with him as much as Barbie, but I was never imagining he was a bad person who would be mean to Barbie. Actually when I was finished with Barbie I would usually put them somewhere together so they could keep each other company and in case Barbie wanted some smooth body loving from her hottie Ken ü•∞ü§™ 
They were supposed to be a inseparable and caring team and I feel like this movie just undid that and it‚Äôs a shame.

I also wonder about the message this sends to boys and men. Like because the Barbie movie kind of ripped on men will they now go, ‚Äúwell the Barbie movie said men were dummies so now we can just go nuts and write women as hot bimbos in everything‚Äù?
I don‚Äôt know I feel like this movie is going to be worse for gender equality than it is better. Yeah I know it‚Äôs a doll movie and won‚Äôt have much impact either way but still.

All in all I‚Äôd give this 2 out of 5 and that‚Äôs mainly because the sets and casting are absolutely wonderful.",2023-08-01 07:09:08,8,movies,BabyCorner91,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1. I think it would have been better if Barbies treated Ken's bad in the beginning of the movie. Maybe ignore them or just kinda mean, but not rude to them. I think that would added more characters to Ken's revolution. And it would make ""Barbie and Ken"" speech later more meaningful.  

2. Gloria's speech at the end relied on the real world too much.  No men treated Glora bad in the movie. Only person who interacted with her was real nice to her. And her husband seems cool too. While it was meaningful, it didn't feel that personal.

You have literal manipulation as a turning point, only to reverse that into Ken not being sure of who he is? Not bad finding oneself but how the story got there was, from a thematic point of view, a bit backwords. Anyway, a few funny moments, a well-thought out movie regardless of what one took from it.

1548,"I was super excited to watch this, hoping it would be great. Honestly thought it wasn't good. I think they had to dig in deeper into the feminist arc, as a man I had no problem with that (as no one should), in fact most of the good laughs from the movie came from that kind of humor. But everything was just so spoon fed, they explained in excruciating detail and the dialogue was boring as hell.

So much stuff just took me out because of how unfunny it was. Everything in mattel was unnecesary and LONG. That scooby doo office chase scene was nowhere near close to being funny in the slightest. All the ""HI KEN, HI BARBIE"" stuff was just head scractching at first and grew superbly old real quick. You see the message the movie wants to deliver from a mile away. The one surprise was that the kens rebel in barbie world and I thought that was incredibly forced and implemented so poorly (though most of the actual good jokes came from the Human character helping out barbies regain themselves).

Overall, to me, most of the jokes didnt land. Barbie ""thinking about dying"" and then the music stops is cringe and not really funny. I dont really see how this is getting so much praise, aside from the incredible Set and World building, which is AMAZINGLY WELL MADE.

The best part of the movie was the last 20 minutes and those were pretty good actually (HORRIBLE ken civil war and dance off aside). Barbie and the creator talking was really sweet. Again, the feminism part (not that I have to care) was ok, it actually brought some of the good jokes.

1549,"Great movie but i guess i hoped the plot and thrill would be a bit more.Felt more like a marvel film with great dialogues and funny lines but nothing of extreme suspense or thrill.

The kens, who were fighting over 'beach' suddenly reading 3 books and then 'brainwashing' the brilliant Barbies into being their bitches was a bad arc, indirectly targeting that if a woman takes the different routel/obeys a man, its not her independent decision but that she is being brainwashed (By Ken) was something that could have been differently done(Kens make a potion perhaps?)

Other than that the confusion that a barbie can do and thnk what she wants but if she doesn't believes in a particular mindset/type of empowerment the  she is being brainwashed and its the patriarchy ,undermining both the Barbies intellect and overstating kens one making it all his fault was also very shallow writing and i really they missed a great plot point here.

Other than the the whole preface its barbies world and she is a girl boss who picks her own ending and does what she wants was great in carrying the message and i hope Greta gets many major franchises after this",2023-07-23 11:43:37,8,movies,Deep_Thinker101,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
1550,"I have some things to talk about ""Barbie"" and another film, being ""Fight Club"". SO PLEASE BE CAREFUL.  
Also please note I watched the film yesterday, and thus may have forgotten some things/misremembered. Thank you.  
>!Barbie is a genuine companion piece to Fight Club. Both films in a sense encourage/may encourage a particular gender to become stronger and more capable, particularly because they are being held down, but in reality both are just using that as a way to appeal, to talk about much more important and far more nuanced points. In particular I have also felt Fight Club is really a film about Cults, while Barbie is about Power Dynamics in general. That's why it may seem that Barbie is mean spirited. Because it's main goal is not to be a role model for people to be. It is trying to show real world dynamics, not just in regards to gender but also media and social classes and even false perceptions in Hollywood, and leaving the door/doors quite literally open to far more stuff (the hallway of doors in the Mattel building). It's one of the smartest films I have ever seen, but it hides it all really damn well, so as to most folks watching it don't get bombarded. But it's truly there.
I think Barbie is trying to be a crash course in power dynamics, with particular focus to gender but also the other things as well. In Barbieland, Barbies are powerful and thus posses many of the same traits as powerful men in our world. They are cocky frankly, and not good people. Kens meanwhile are submissive to Barbies, who treat them as shit. But Kens are also not necessarily the best of folks. AKA the real world. This gender reversal stuff is obvious, but what I think folks are missing is that this is actually a key to decode the whole film. The moment you do that, you realize in reality the film isn't trying to be purely feminist message, but actually far more interested in how things today are playing out. And have been and will keep being. ""The real world"" here still isn't completely the real world. I mean I know that is obvious, but it let's you realize the points made in it are also trying to be satirically done.
In particular, Margot Robbie's Barbie (hence forth just called Barbie) can be considered to be a powerful/sheltered person realizing issues of the real world, and understanding the depths and nuances of it. Akin to the Buddha one can say, especially with a character saying ""my savior"". Ryan Gosling's Ken (hence forth just called Ken) I feel is a more satirical critique of Hollywood and Media, with it's overt messaging but not understanding the truth and deep nuances of it, which will actually make things better. This is extremely well showcased by the critical scene in which Barbie and Ken do show up to the real world at the Beach, and Barbie feels threatened not just by of course the awful cruel men, but one can also view it as her feeling threatened due to the unfamiliarity of it. Like a rich kid walking through a bad neighborhood. I feel this is most powerfully represented by Barbie stating she ""has no genitalia"" to the construction workers while Ken saying he has ""all of the genitalia."" And the construction worker's reaction being ""okay."" Now one can say this is obviously a way to represent how Barbie shouldn't actually be subject to the comments imposed upon her, but I also really really feel that this is a hint to indicate that ""hey guys, it's not just sex"" which is absolutely obvious when Will Ferrel shows up.
Now before I fully open that can of worms, I want to talk about Ken. Ken I feel is representing/a way to learn the powers men have in reality (duh), but also how many women are currently being in Hollywood and media. ""I have all of the genitalia."" Bingo you know. Particularly, I think Ken represents (I am going to get so much shit for this) negative folks who are supporters of Feminism who, such as many people and particularly actresses in Hollywood, are toxic by trying to demean men. ""Patriarchy"" is a substitute word for Feminism. Remember, its all a big gender reversal. Of particular note is how even then, a thing about Ken's actions is how the other Kens in Barbieland actually do become smart and educated and aren't completely useless at all anymore. Sure they abuse their power, but they aren't idiots now. It is akin to showing that positives even out of that toxicity is emerging, including int our own real world.
Okay, now time to talk about Barbie again. So Barbie is very much a representation of rich and powerful folks. She just gets her new clothes with Ken and then runs away not paying for them, like how many view rich folks doing today. The kicker being how innocent it is for her. But then she relaizes the struggles of normal folks and how WOMEN AND MEN are struggling. More evidence to suggest that the film even if it shows women being unfair towards men (at leats Barbies to Kens), this film doesn't hate men. But then comes the moment she meets the key to all of the films great intentions. She meets Will Ferrel.
Will Ferrel's character is really important. His pink colors and power clearly symbolise he is like Barbie. One could also say his emasculation to an extent is a nod to Fight Club, and believe me there are far bigger nods then that (the color pink it self is a big one). But Will Ferrel is representative of the Status Quo most of all. He represents how he deeply cares about things being the way they are for power and corporations. They want things to remain, cause they have figured out ways it can benefit them in frankly nuanced manners, but still don't want that equilibrium disturbed as they are lazy now. They may even be aware of reality (he refers at the end to know Ruth), but as long as she is hidden away, that's okay for him. Reality isn't of concern if it doesn't impact the image crafted. Now there is some falsehood in this as Mattel literally in a sense is letting this film make Barbie into a feminist icon, but I feel that is represented as well with companies not being complete idiots to laziness if more profits can also be achieved. Its a unique thin line they traverse. They are both creative and lazy, greedy yet helpful, changing and static. They are enigmas, that frankly even they don't understand in how they impact the world, and are imapcted by it too. But one thng is for sure, and this gets more into the hollywood side of things. A powerful and un-nuanced image is appealing, with Will Ferrel shooting down the idea to have both Barbie and Ken well represented.
Okay I relaized I skipped actually tlaking about Barbie (kind of stream of conciousness here), but to talk about her I need to talk about Ken again. One of the scenes that caught my attention is when Ken talks to a guy and hey says the patriarchy is very well hidden. This patriarchy I don't think is a substitute for feminism in this instance, but actually refers to have male power nowadays is hidden. But it then does something really brilliant in my opinion, and has a scene I think years from now will be referred to as one of the greatest scenes in movie history. The scene when barbie meets ruth in one of the hidden rooms. Ruth tlaks about her power, and is literally HIDDEN. The main point of the film is present their. Power dynamics are way way way more complex then portrayed in general media. We all know this as well. It's just a question of who ends up in the spotlight. This hidde quality is amplified in Babrieland after the Ken's take over, with the Barbie's secretly reasserting power while being hidden. Of particular note how this is represented in the real world is by Will Ferrel as well. He is a harmless man, beholden to Women's interests. But the patriarchy is now hidden too.
Finally, I want to talk about Alvin and the family Barbie is trying to help. These folks are the real people, who like Will Ferrel also don't understand their true power, yet kinda may as well. I will be honest, I feel I need to watch the film again to make truly conclusive points regarding them, but some ideas is younger generations impatience and also young childrens vulnerablity to media, but also how positive role models exist trying to do the best they can. A healthy power relationship. A mom and her kids. Feel kinda shitty to call this a power based relationship. Other things maybe how Alvin is really awesome, but is screwed in both eras of Barbieland. How the common person is always in the dumps, women more so in reality, but men too. The film nicely showcases this by showing how men out of power are still better off, but still not as well of as powerful folks in general.
As far as allusions to Fight Club, there are literally two references to it with men saying let us help reflecting the ""WELCOME!"" ad and the literally ""you are not your"" type of speech, all the more confirming this film's wish to be a companion piece to Fight Club, which is needed I feel (taking into account Fight Club is my favorite film). As far as other things, there are so many more little if not big things but for now I think this is a lot. This film is way smarter then people are giving it credit for, which is why I felt it was important for me to write about this.!<

1570,"So after seeing it, I was hoping for more.


It has corporate apologia, and the ken issue I feel takes away from the movie. Ken is an incel, but he is also a stand in for women in the Barbie world which is already yikes. On the stand in side, the ken's take over, and everything goes downhill, so it's subtly pushing the idea that if women got power things wouldn't work out. On the incel side, the movie has Barbie apologize to ken, but I don't remember ken apologizing to Barbie for how he acted.


It says all the right things. It calls out the issues that women face. But it's all just words. It's a case of telling and now showing. Not dealing with. While the movie says the right words about being about women empowerment, what the movie is about is more focused around the programming and deprogramming of an incel. And that responsibility shouldn't be placed on women (Not that they can't chose to take it up, but it shouldn't be assumed that incels are their fault, or that they have to fix them).


It made promises at the start that it didn't keep. After the opening (and later when both the mother and the daughter give their rants) I wanted to see those issues explored instead of taking a backseat to some cishet blond white guy that can't accept a girl he thinks he likes not being into him. I wanted more 'Thank God I'm Pretty.' Why must women always take a back seat to men in movies?


And what's worse, it acknowledged the issues. But it had to do more that. It's a better movie than most others, but I think it still falls behind the likes of something like Everything Everywhere All At Once. And it hurts because of that opening promise. If it didn't have those moments, I probably would be less critical (though still unhappy about making CEOs just goofy instead of the sociopaths they are).


‚ÄãIt had some catchy songs though.",2023-07-23 22:00:48,8,movies,jakinbandw,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
1571,"I liked it, I don't get criticism about the movie being ""too feminist"", it's a movie about Barbie ffs. Had plenty of hilarious scenes, busted blokes' chops heaps, and the message behind it was surprisingly self-aware and poignant and worked within the medium, rather than pulling punches or completely demonising men to get the point across, it was done with tact. I thought it was pretty good and just the right amount of goofy. I can see why Ben Shapiro felt emasculated by it, Ken looked better in the black shirt pants combo. Margot killed it, Michael Cera was a favourite with myself and my friends who I went to see it with, it was great. Would see again.",2023-07-26 16:33:11,8,movies,SopranosBluRayBoxSet,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
1572,"This is the first movie I've ever gone into theaters to see twice. It's not perfect but going in with 2 different theater audiences definitely made a difference in how much I enjoyed it. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed it, especially Ryan Gosling knocking it out of the park as Ken

Gosling might be my favorite actor out there, his filmography is stacked & this performance just adds to it. Hopefully, he gets nominated & maybe wins Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards but he'll be in tough competition with RDJ & his performance in Oppenheimer",2023-08-16 03:40:07,8,movies,Shaymin7127,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
1573,"I watched it with my mother and my grandmother (a retired feminist professor) tonight. Frankly, it hit the right notes. I would say we all enjoyed the film. I'm trans nonbinary, so I died laughing the entire time and the end made me cry.  My mom thought it got a little too vapid with how they portrayed the Barbieland, but she liked the nostalgia of the various toys. My grandmother felt it dragged a little in the middle, but it tied the end up well. 

Usually one of us dislikes the movie we all see, so I'd give it a recommendation. I would say, you really gotta be willing to take a lot of camp and satire about gender roles. 

The movie is also very pink lol. The aesthetic was interesting and well executed. The actors all brought their A-game. Kate McKinnon absolutely nailed it.",2023-07-27 22:29:41,8,movies,greengengar,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

Reviewers complaining about all the patriarchy references clearly haven‚Äôt noticed the number movies in which men take precedence, simply because in those movies, the politics are not displayed as blatantly as they are in this one.

I feel that many points made in the movie has a backing for them in reality, but it was extremely over the top in almost every way, of course, because it‚Äôs a movie. A Barbie movie. If you actually think this movie is realistic in it‚Äôs entirety, then you probably shouldn‚Äôt be reviewing it.

1578,"Absolutely spectacular.  We did a Barbie Oppenheimer double feature, and can't recommend it more.  Surprisingly, Barbie was the more thought provoking of the two.  I'm glad I avoided spoilers and whatever weird culture war was going on over this because I absolutely love sincere metamodernist works like Everything Everywhere All at Once and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.  I don't just want to hear people complaining about problems I already am well aware of and live through every day in my satirical entertainment.  I want to feel genuine and positive emotions, and understand that we could do better if we would simply choose to imagine it.

And imagination was really the core of this movie.  I felt like the point at the end was a little too spoon fed, particularly with the whole conversation with Ruth, and the male perspective was perhaps too subtle and glossed over (but yeah, it's a Barbie movie so okay).  I absolutely loved how they juxtaposed Barbieland as the result of female imagination with Reality as the result of male imagination, but I just wish there was more to drive home that point rather than Ruth flat out saying something along the lines of ""Whether it's Barbie or Patriarchy, it's all imaginary.""  If the movie had made that point more apparent, perhaps they wouldn't have had to come out and say it outright at the end.

Also, the comedy was on point.  When Ken arrived in the real world, it felt like an extended version of Taylor Swift's music video for The Man, and as a man there was a lot to relate to.  I loved the horse confusion, and the line, ""Once I found out patriarchy wasn't about horses, I kind of lost interest.""  In fact, as a man I really enjoyed a lot of the satire around the patriarchy because something that's often missed in discussions about it is the negative effects on men, and I think discussing that more would go a long ways to de-radicalizing a lot of the misogynist ""Men's Rights"" type reactionaries out there.  Will Ferrell's character and Ken's whole ""It's so hard being in charge!"" stuff was very on point.

I imagine it hit harder for a lot of women, though.  While I appreciated the satire of men's roles in a patriarchy, the movie focused more on women and a kind of Wakanda for women of what could be if more women were in positions of power.",2023-07-23 02:24:19,8,movies,-Clayburn,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

I get that it's a kids movie so to them there might be something they'd never thought about or cared to think about. And America's monologs at the end was very cringey. It's not that I disagree with anything she says really, it's just that it could've been something so much more real.

First off, I'm a guy, and I couldn't wait to see this. The jokes were on-point and the performances were so magnetic. But it just felt like this movie just constantly shit on men with a vague message. I have no problem with the first two thirds of this movie. Ken needing Barbie's approval to validate himself is relatable and hilarious. Him discovering patriarchy and all the other Kens mansplaining things were so on point (except for the photoshop part. Idk why that should be considered mansplaining), and America's monologue was powerful. Where this movie lost me was how in the end, after the beach-off, everything goes back to normal and the Kens just get the same shit deal.

At this day and age, where trans and gender identity is a big deal, is whole men vs women thing even important? 

If you throw out patriarchy and make the society lean towards matriarchy, you are basically doing same thing, just reversing the roles. What about equal representation, in parliament, everywhere?

Therefore I decided to balance it out by giving Ken a voice as well. 
I imagined a conversation about unrealistic role expectations that Barbie could have had with Ken, just for both to find out that their struggles overlap significantly. 
Being convinced that due to acknowledging and better understanding each other, society can truly move forward. In the end, nobody is (or can be) perfect, since we‚Äôre all (just) humans‚Ä¶

I would appreciate feedback, since giving Ken a voice as an inexperienced video editor surely took some time&effort.

1610,"A whole lot of potential but a lot of misses with the humorous bits. I don't think the writing is as sharp and witty as they intended to come across. For example, the scene with Sasha being urged to ""destroy Barbie"" didn't work for me. The lines weren't biting enough and were not immediately relatable observations; the drums that were supposed to emphasise the hard punches of truth that Sasha were throwing were lagging and doesn't help that the words were weak...and in the end it built up to nothing, no mic drop or climax. Ryan Murphy would be the person to come up with effective lines (think Santana, Kurt and most of all Sue Sylvester's lines from GLEE). 

The movie had parts that were too abstract that made me wonder if it's lazy writing that was self-convinced to be quirky, random ""oh it's a movie, it doesn't have to make sense"" and ""they'll get it"" sort of humour and ""deep"". The characters were forgettable and wasted opportunities, none of them were truly funny and unique or iconic. It's not toy story-touching, Pixar-deep or chick-flick classic.

So whatever revelation the characters were having, to me it seemed like they were just being silly and saying things in a silly way. So at the end, i ended up not feeling any connection to the themes and the story.

1616,"I have been scrolling through the top comments about this Barbie/women-centred movie for about 15 minutes, and so far they are almost all about Gosling/Ken (even some Alan)...! The irony. Dudes (I'm guessing) really do mostly care about dudes - even silly dudes who are the butt of the jokes.

Margot Robbie was my MVP and the only element that 100% worked for me, without qualifications. A pitch-perfect performance - not a single false note. In that party dance number, she was possibly the most radiant thing I've ever seen on a screen; I was in awe.",2023-07-26 13:03:37,7,movies,Milevengelist,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
1617,"The sad reality is, our society's sexism, and prejudice is strongly toxic, very much so this Barbie touched on these topic was very important.

Anyone humbled after seeing this movie with these beautiful messages, good for you. But those, continues to hate and exercise sexism, or prejudice in anyway, probably are the ones set on hating on this movie no matter what and they are THE problem in our society.",2023-07-27 14:36:25,7,movies,DonYoda22,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
1618,"I have to see it as fun and campy romp. Margo had some good beats and Ryan stole the show but the larger plot and the themes felt rather uninspired and lazy. Feels like the same kind of white woman feminism you see on Twitter (or saw on Tumblr back in the day) nowadays. All in all, still fine, but I feel like if you're seeing this film and viewing the finale as some grand feminist outcome then I really doubt we have the same view of a feminist end game. As a fun and campy romp touching on gender issues but not committing to exploring them with the depth needed? 8/10. As a subversive satire of gender norms and some grand piece of feminist art? 5/10. 

.

I really feel that they just tried to address too much and this sacrificed the nuances needed to actually have this be something worthy of great feminist praise in 2023 yaknow? What I'm really not a fan of is all the people who love it, but are unable to recognize any criticism of it. Who treat any discomfort at the choice of having all the men be either idiots or idiots/shitheads, as proof they're some Jordan Peterson fanboy. Frankly I have to thank it, because it will be a good litmus test going forward to determine if someone has what I see as a toxic view of feminism. Similar to guys and their view of fight club and how it handled masculinity.


.

Edit; I do want to absolutely sing the praises again of Margo, Ryan, the set designs, and the music. I get what they were trying to go for as a whole, and while I think they only really nailed Ken's story, I feel it just missed the mark thematically. I said elsewhere, it rightfully criticizes toxic masculinity but paints masculinity as performative without bothering to show examples of positive masculinity. As well as seemingly justifying the sexist ways women have been treated in society by saying ""eh maybe eventually you'll get equality but for now just take what we give you and shut up"". All in all... Maybe I was just expecting too much, but considering how amazing Greta is as a filmmaker I really don't think I was.",2023-07-22 19:30:15,7,movies,,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1620,"I was fully expecting to majorly disagree with the movie but I didn't. I found it was saying in the face of all the gender bullshit that it's all about individualism and finding oneself and that Barbies were intended to help with that despite its initially dated ways.


While ultimately it dismissed the gender politics by the end, which I thought was great, I found when it did kind of dive into it at half-way, it was a bit confused (women apparently hold no power in the real world except when in the mirroring Kenland they effortlessly create a war among them for their affection - as history reflects), but who isn't? The movie more or less dismisses it all anyways.

One small moment that carries the theme and that I really appreciated was the scene with the FBI agent calling Mattel: the FBI guy's office was colorful and full of personal materials, which is very much against the usual depictions about the FBI in movies.",2023-08-02 00:58:08,7,movies,Peteskies,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

I mean what kind of message is that to send to little kids? 

And yes I know this wasn‚Äôt a kids movie and no, we didn‚Äôt personally take our daughter, but the theatre I was at was full of little kids.

1625,"So regarding Barbie having a negative impact on girls/women and the edgy teen roasting Barbie....is that even true? I highly doubt Barbie ""set back women 50 years"". That's just conjecture. Barbie at the worst just represented society in that moment. 

Now before someone comes at me with ""Barbie promotes an impossible standard yada yada"" Do we have quantifiable data to say Barbie has caused X amount of damage to girls/women, slowed down women's advancement (funny enough a big counter hysteria regarding unrealistic Barbie standards may have actually ended up helping women, thus Barbie helping), or just a small handful of people raised hell with their personal critiques about Barbie and how Barbie personally made them feel. Those takes were able to gain some mainstream traction and embed themselves within the cultural psyche. 

I honestly think most girls that played with Barbie as children have positive feedback on Barbie dolls. Some insensitive/poorly executed dolls throughout the decades doesn't matter that much, and the counter reaction more than makes up for those dolls (and helped make this movie).",2023-07-22 08:44:34,7,movies,YoSoyWalrus,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

I was expecting raucous laughter to permeate most of this film but it never really came. The pacing was a bit off and the script was super weak at times, IMO, and that was made more apparent with a stacked cast who you all know can act. However, Gosling is one of my all-time favs and, like every other project, gives it 115% and elevates every moment.

In the end they acknowledge that both sides had problems and decided to try and implement real equality between the kens and Barbie's.

Also with the Barbie's being the more dominant gender being that it is barbieworld and therefore they hold the prominent positions of power and play the important roles (president/doctors/cops/military), so shouldn't ken be the one learning from the real world that they can be anything and not just a Barbie accessory??",2023-07-25 06:13:25,7,movies,jgodham,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

Everything moved so fast we never got time to really settle into a ruleset before we were introduced to another. The last act was a great idea but it was over so soon, same with the first. For the middle, well light spoilers bur. She spends 5 minutes in the ""real world"" it seems, not enough to really sell the necessity of that plotline.

I like the film, but, as a feminist who genuinely believes in the message it tried to get across about women just getting the short end of the stick no matter what, I think the way they went about doing that was too‚Ä¶ on the nose? Hollow? I‚Äôm not sure what word to use exactly, but I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of how it was handled. Either way, powerful message.

1641,"SOME SPOILERS AHEAD‚ÄºÔ∏è

I‚Äôm going to be honest, I think this is one of my new all-time favorite films! It was such a creative take on the doll we all know and love. The attention to detail in the set and the fashion was iconic (it made my inner child happy!!) I love the historical elements of Mattel embedded into the film. And the writing was sublime‚Ä¶ the dialogue between the characters and the overall empowering messages from the film that the audience could relate to. We all struggle with insecurities to some extent, so I appreciated the theme of self-love/acceptance. My other main takeaways were: you shouldn‚Äôt spend your life trying to define yourself through someone else, enjoy the simple pleasures in life, knowing your worth, it‚Äôs ok for both men and women to show vulnerability, you are not defined by your career, confronting mortality, and recognizing the beauty of imperfections/pain. Another detail I loved was the diversity of the cast‚Ä¶ since Barbie is supposed to represent girls that can be anything, it was nice to see the idea of various  backgrounds represented. 

Margot Robbie IS Barbie. I couldn‚Äôt think of a better person to play this character. Ryan Gosling honestly was the star every scene he was in. I loved his rivalry with Simu Liu (that dance off scene was iconic‚Ä¶ or should I say beach off üòâ) Don‚Äôt get me started with the horses üòÇI was laughing way too hard üò≠üêé Alan and ‚ÄúWeird Barbie‚Äù were super fun characters. America Ferrera‚Äôs dialogue was amazing. I also loved the cameo with the ‚Äúcreator‚Äù of Barbie and the dialogue between the two of them. The ending resonated with me and made me tear up a bit! I think this movie will stand the test of time and become a frequently revisited classic. It‚Äôs a perfect balance of wacky fun and depth. Completely worth the hype. Beautiful film! 5/5 stars! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è",2023-07-25 12:31:06,7,movies,fireflychild024,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1647,"I can see the real world bits being a drag for some people but I love that Ken spent 5 minutes in it and decided the patriarchy was cool. That's fucking hilarious to me. And totally makes sense with how sad Ken is. But it's delivered with the perfect amount of wimpiness but a kind of vulnerability. Or maybe I just love Ryan Gosling that's a strong possibility.

And I think Robbie did manage to nail what was needed from Barbie in a movie where she kind of has to react to the weirder world around her while also explaining her naive worldview. She also nailed the silly bits of literally rolling on the ground too. 

And I do love that Skipper escaped before, the execs know about Barbieland and know that the ghost of Ruth lives on the 14th floor. There's some weird Toy Story X Men In Black movie I kind of want to see there.

1650,"as a woman, the barbie movie really didn't do it for me. it screams of an overly simplified and whitewashed, rainbows and butterflies portrait of feminism that's a far cry from reality. in the real world, racism and poverty are deeply intertwined with the struggle for gender equality. the movie paints the picture that if women just stick together, stay strong, and have big dreams, we can defeat the patriarchy!!! but haven't women been doing that already this whole time? the fight against sexism looks vastly different for a disabled, poor, queer woman of color vs a financially privileged, able bodied white woman. the movie has plenty of diversity, but paints their struggles as all the same, using them as little more than token minorities. it's quite patronizing, but a lot of people will never be ready for that conversation. it was cute and all, and i'm always for female empowerment, but it is not the feminist masterpiece people are praising it to be. for such a ~woke~ movie, it really wasn't very woke at all.",2024-01-24 22:46:18,7,movies,antheiafae,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1655,"How does everyone interpret the creator's final quote?
_‚ÄúWe mothers stand still so our daughters can look back to see how far they've come.‚Äù_

I'm not a native English speaker, but I see many people on Twitter saying it basically means the mother stops everything to live though her daughter, is this what it actually means? Or is it open to interpretation?

Because I thought it was sort of a double entendre on the feminist cause. Ruth created Barbie to inspire little girls to be what they really want to be, and now her daughter barbie doesn't want to just inspire but actually help on the field.

I felt like it meant that past to a certain point, the first generation of women fighting for gender equality needs to let the next one do it, as they will be outgrown by their own cause. They might not understand this new generation's take on their fight, but it is probably because they did their part and have achieved progress.

1690,"Really good film, it's rare for humour to land for me as much as Barbie did. 

The one thing I wasn't a massive fan of though (and maybe others would disagree) was that Ken only reflected on his ideology being wrong after he was defeated. It felt a bit weird that the film asked us to feel sympathy for Ken when a few minutes before he was cool with hypnotising the Barbies into basically being slaves (I suppose Ken is dumb enough to have not realised what he was doing but still), he basically only started reflecting on himself because he lost. It would have felt more genuine if he'd come to the realisation that what he was doing was wrong whilst still in control and then because of it he and the other Kens could have decided to vote against their own constitution change. On the other *hand doing that would probably mean writing out the Ken battle scene, and that was far too much fun to not include in the script.",2023-07-24 16:23:54,6,movies,duckwantbread,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1698,"Overall, this was a lot of fun. Saw it at the drive-in with my wife for an extra dose of nostalgia. Plus, she‚Äôs 30 weeks pregnant, so we really enjoyed Midge (Pregnant Barbie)!

I realized about 90% through the runtime that the ‚ÄúReal World‚Äù plot didn‚Äôt really matter. I‚Äôm not sure exactly what I expected, but I thought Barbie going to the Real World and fixing something was going to be the main plot line, but it sort of felt irrelevant by the end. The story was more about Barbie and Ken, in Barbieland/Kendom and figuring out who they were. Which was great. I could have done without the mother/daughter/Mattel employees and just had a deeper dive into Barbie and Ken. Going to the Real World was just a way to introduce the patriarchy to Ken, which they could have got to in other ways. 

Still really enjoyed the whole thing, though! McKinnon was great with Weird Barbie, and Cera as Allan. Depression Barbie was hilarious. Loved Ken discovering ‚Äúmasculinity,‚Äù the obsession with horses, ‚ÄúI am Kenough,‚Äù the beach off with accompanying dance number‚Ä¶Gosling was absolutely fantastic as Ken.

I had a general idea of the plot and I think I share that with other people that we knew Barbie goes to the real world and has an existential crisis/experience.  I think the trailer, cast, and general promo did an exceptional job at keeping the plot vague because I had no idea what was coming next. I saw one tweet from a random user about who could possibly be a villain but I didn‚Äôt pay it any mind because it seemed so off base, but it wasn‚Äôt! 

I laughed so much and enjoyed the emotional moments although I was very confused on where things were going.

1707,"10/10. This movie was everything i wanted it to be and more. A lot of posters are complaining about its lack of subtleness. While there certain themes thrown in the viewer's face, there was also layers of feminist theory and intersectionality baked into every layer of this film. 

Ultimately, I think think Barbieland is supposed to represent the women (and more specifically white feminists) who believe the feminist movement has already won- think the ‚Äúgirl boss‚Äù type. So many women argue now that the feminist movement is done, equality has been achieved- ignoring the barriers still in place for many women, especially those with intersecting identities. 

That‚Äôs why it takes America Ferrera‚Äòs character and her daughter, women with intersecting identities, to teach Barbie that her brand of feminism has not helped or solved all the problems for every women. By the end of the movie, Barbie‚Äôs decision to leave Barbieland and go to the real world represents how she‚Äôs accepted this reality and no longer wants to live behind the veil of ignorance. 

It also represents how this ‚Äúgirl power‚Äù feminism is commercialized and sold to women. Like how Mattel and its executive board of men still control Barbieland behind the scenes, girl boss feminism ignores that men still hold much of power in the world. And tagging #girlboss on IG photos doesn‚Äòt change this. 

This movie is also clearly criticizing white beauty standards. This is illustrated by America Ferrera‚Äôs character, a Latino women, sketching a blonde white women and later telling Barbie ‚ÄùI can‚Äôt be you.‚Äù This is commentary on the impact of media that has traditionally presented white beauty standards as ideal has on non-white women from an early age. It also shows the impact of unattainable beauty standards on even women like Barbie- or real life women like Marilyn Monroe- who do fit these ideal standards.

America Ferrera‚Äòs speech at the end that cures the Barbies is literally the concept of double consciousness first theorized by W.E.B. DuBois, a notable early civil rights thinker and activist. There‚Äôs so much more that I could dive into, but whoever wrote this script is clearly well-versed in feminist film theory. I could write a master‚Äôs thesis about all the theory presented in this film.   


Lastly, I find it laughable that people think the end of the movie invalidates the message of the film. Barbieland reverses gender roles. So this represents how in the real world, even when feminists ‚Äúwon‚Äú battles like securing the right to vote, it still took decades for meaningful change to be implemented. Expecting that change to be immediate when gender roles are reversed is irony at its finest. They‚Äôre missing the point that both the patriarchy and feminism are institutions and ideas people invented to deal with living in a shitty world. There isn‚Äôt a magical way to fix it- we saw how everyone was negatively impacted in some fashion by both the gender roles and systems in the real world and Barbieland. However, by acknowledging this dynamic and emphasizing with each other, we can begin to fix it.

I think this movie did a fantastic job in bringing to light criticisms of both feminism and the patriarchy. It uses satire in a very similar way to the Scum Manifesto, which is going to going over a lot of people‚Äôs heads. Regardless, I loved every minute of it and am glad this movie is bringing these conversations into  the spotlight.",2023-07-25 22:28:37,6,movies,Dismal-Channel-9292,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1722,"(Rant, Spoilers ahead)

&#x200B;

I (17M) liked Barbie. However I cannot get the thought out of my head that it is at least somewhat against true equality between genders. What I got from the movie is that yes (duh) women face many issues that are talked about but disregarded, point to the whole monologue Gloria gives, and that the movie is a way to talk about those issue and put them in the forefront of peoples' minds. Nonetheless I still think that it's somewhat anti-male, at the end of the film once Ken realizes that his ""patriarchy"" is over and begins to cry and talk about how he is nothing without Barbie only for her to tell him to find out who he is for himself, is a great scene showing how Barbie truly does care for Ken and he doesn't need her to be his truest self. Yet they then follow that scene with another where Simu Liu's Ken asks for a role in the Supreme Court only to be immediately turned down and told no way, but he could have a secretary type of position; only for it again to be played out as a joke where he says he just wants to wear robes. Even having Helen Mirren the narrator of the story say, ""Eventually the Kens' will have the same amount of power women have in the real world."" Like why was this put in not only does it still point out the fact that everything the Barbies' did had no effect on the real world, but it puts down the Kens' as well. The Barbies end up putting everything back to as it was before Ken had instilled his ""Patriarchy"" why? Why not change it to have true equality for both groups. Ryan Goslings Ken points out that before he changed everything he was simply a thing for Barbie to look at and when she didn't he didn't have a good day. So why change the constitution back to a system where one group of people are still being demeaned to nothing. The Kens were just as much indoctrinated by Ryan Gosling as the other Barbies were. It's not right to say they weren't just because they now held the power. I just think that if the Barbies understood what it was like from Gloria and their own experiences of how it feels to be in a situation where you are clearly second fiddle and everyone sees you as an object why change everything back to the way it was still having a group of people being demeaned. It shows that they are no better than when the Kens had power. All in all the Barbies should have changed the system to accommodate both groups of people to have equal power and relevance after experiencing for themselves first hand what it was like. Also include Alan man he needs some justice too.",2023-07-28 02:09:54,6,movies,ACCTForDiscussion,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
1723,"I really liked the movie but I feel like it could have been better and more streamlined.

1727,"Gonna preface this by saying I think Ladybird is an excellent film and Little Women is one of my favorite movies of all time (possibly top 5), so I was always planning on watching Barbie on premiere night before the crazy marketing or Oppenheimer memes even were a thing.

It fell a little... flat for me? I liked the movie overall but it's like a 7.5 for me. I think the overall message was great, the actors for the most part did a great job, with standouts obviously being Gosling and Robbie. Their imagination for the sets was outstanding, every one looked better than the other. Music was great. Greta Gerwig directed the FUCK out of every shot and I loved her dialogue as always. But it didn't have the ""it"" factor of Little Women for me.

America Ferreras speech was a nice moment but it doesn't even begin to come close to Jo's speech about being lonely, or Laurie's proposal, or Amy's speech about marriage being an economic proposition.

The Mattel subplot REALLY didn't need to be extended to Barbieland. The scenes with Ruth didn't really impact me except the ""Mothers stand still so their daughter can see how far they've come"" line.

Again, by no means I'm saying it was a bad movie. It was a very good movie that just fell short of being a great one by not quite striking the balance between pop culture silliness and genuine sentimentality.",2023-07-21 05:19:42,6,movies,KingHafez,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1729,"I loved this movie. It did a very challenging thing: combining genuinely funny, surreal, and existential moments with having a message about empowerment and identity, while also pushing a corporate mythology about a much beloved toy. I could have done with less of the last bit, but when you‚Äôre making a big budget movie with a licensed product, you‚Äôre beholden to the product‚Äôs masters and you have to give a little. I actually credit Mattel for allowing someone to take such a weird swing.

I had a question that I‚Äôd like some opinions on: When Ken sings the ‚Äú[I‚Äôm just Ken](https://youtu.be/wwux9KiBMjE)‚Äù song, are we to take it as an expression of someone having self-worth but they feel crushed by a system that keeps them as an appendage the Barbies? ‚Äî like if the situation was in the real world, this would be a woman singing a song about how she is trapped by the patriarchy and feels like she has so much more to offer the world than superficial things. 

*OR* was the song a statement of male power in support of continuing the patriarchal system that Ken imported from the real world? In the moment, is Ken asking to be appreciated for who he is, or is he boastful and egotistical. 

I know that‚Äôs crazy to fixate on but I couldn‚Äôt get the question out of my head after seeing the movie last night.",2023-07-25 18:03:18,6,movies,TheElbow,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

Only part I'm still kind of on the middle on is America's monologue. I liked the message of the movie, but I liked it when it wasn't being so serious about the delivery. It gave its message for most of the movie without breaking its comedic routine. The movie just leans so much into humor though that it kind of caught me off guard. Not a bad thing, but when you try to dance on that fine line between being serious and comedy it can be hit or miss. Luckily, I think the movie JUST stays on the line with it though for me. Overall I loved it.

Every time Ryan was on screen I cracked up. The Kens in general were just plain silly. The watch bit killed me.

1741,"My mother just uncovered a nice little connection between the Kens and horses which may seem obvious, but only when she said it it clicked for me. 

I could not explain Ken's obsession with horses to myself entirely before being reminded that there is this mythical (Greek) creature called a ""**centaur""**, half man, bottom half horse. 

In my native language, Croatian, the word is spelled and pronounced ""Kentaur"" which makes the connection even more obvious, unlike in English. Centaurs are one of the symbols of **manliness, virility, male fertility** which help connect the two (Kens and horses) in the movie. 

Plus, the name, especially in Croatian, seems to be too similar to be a coincidence, if they did any research on the symbolism of horses, I feel like they must've stumbled upon the Centaur and a non-English pronunciation/spelling like Croatian, or the original and most likely choice  of **transliterated Greek (ŒöŒ≠ŒΩœÑŒ±œÖœÅŒøœÇ --> Kentauros)**

1747,"The film could have gone in harder. I understand why it didn't, but, for example, Barbie could have used the word 'suicide' instead of 'dying' since that is the ideation that her real world counterpart was fixated on. America Ferrara's speech was wonderful and I don't disregard any of the micro aggressions and inequities she mentioned, but while we are talking about the patriarchy, we could talk about women being put in prison for having miscarriages or men being given lenient sentences because of what the 12-year-old was wearing that night. Greta Gerwig is a thoughtful artist and a savvy filmmaker, and she knows the lines she can't cross, but for people like Shapiro to whine about the film's message when it could have gone so much more for the jugular is snowflake-level.",2023-07-27 05:14:45,6,movies,,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]
1748,"The more I think about this movie the more I wish it had invoked a disconnect between the barbies that were designed to sell clothes and the barbies with careers that were supposed to empower little girls. Our barbie‚Äôs existential crisis could‚Äôve been boosted by her feeling out of place as a barbie with no career or purpose in Barbieland, slowly being phased out. In fact, they could‚Äôve even shown her doll form in the real world as an older model passed down to Sasha from Gloria or even Gloria‚Äôs mother, as a representation of the first generation of girls who played with Barbie. Our Barbie‚Äôs malfunctioning not only because of Gloria‚Äôs mid life crisis but also because her doll form is showing signs of wear and tear. It probably could‚Äôve made Barbie crying over being ugly more impactful if there was a shadowy place in Barbieland for all the weird and broken barbies that Barbie was scared of being exiled to because she‚Äôs now imperfect.

I found Gloria‚Äôs suggestion of an ordinary Barbie kind of laughable and underwhelming as an ending but I do think there was a way to have a similar beat and hit harder. Have her suggest ordinary barbies that don‚Äôt have to be hyperfeminine or perfect or need to be everything because it‚Äôs putting too much pressure on young girls like Sasha. There‚Äôs space for tomboy Barbie and flat footed Barbie who likes sneakers. And the career barbies can realize they don‚Äôt need to be defined by their careers. President Barbie can be Totally Hair Barbie if she wants to be and vice versa. The Kens doesn‚Äôt need a Supreme Court seat but they can start by being given their own careers and jobs in Barbieland, helping ease Barbie‚Äôs burden of feeling like they need to be and do everything.

And I said this in a different comment but I really wish they had acknowledged Allan and Midge are a couple and done more with Midge than treat her as a gag (really, why wasn‚Äôt she with the rest of the discontinued barbies?) It would‚Äôve been funnier to reveal Allan is the only male doll with a successful relationship while the barbies and kens are in low commitment long distance limbo. Or worse, having  a modern Alan doll that‚Äôs completely separate from his 1960s version who‚Äôs in a relationship with pregnant Midge. Allan doesn‚Äôt have his 1960s Midge.",2023-07-26 16:32:53,6,movies,Anrw,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

Personally it seemed more of a message to women out there which is understandably hard for kids to grasp, I generally thought this movie was just gonna be an IRL Barbie movie but it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs super meaningful and very emotional.

And also this is a part of the realization that we are grown and that Barbie, who‚Äôs supposed to be this perfect woman who has a perfect life and all is shown to also struggle with insecurities and also go through these difficult situations humans go through. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs for children, they are just simply not old enough to understand the concept of the movie, they shouldn‚Äôt be introduced to that big world yet, their still in their prime years and are still shielded from the world, which they should be.

I also can't tell who the movie is for in terms of demographics. It definitely wasn't for younger kids or teenagers. Theres nothing particularly gen z or early millenial either. It kind of seems like it's for older millenial and gen x women, but then there's jokes like the Snyder cut one which makes me think they tried to put in something for everyone.",2023-07-26 07:04:23,5,movies,stuartseupaul,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1775,"As a young man, I seriously didn't expect to get this invested with anything Barbie-related until now, let alone successfully pulling off a live-action feature-film based on ""Barbie"" for mainstream audiences to enjoy. This movie has a lot of heart and actually thought-provoking at times while also not taking itself too seriously. When news was first announced that a Barbie Movie entered production on April 2014. Tons of users including me weren't sold on this idea fearing it would end up like one of those cheesy Barbie DVD movies.

During my childhood, I used to avoid anything ""Girl related"" in fear of getting picked on or bullied by a few male students and friends I made during my childhood and school years. Before the 2010s hit, there was a huge stigma  when boys would be judged harshly if they liked anything ""feminine"" and ""cute"". You would even be called or accused of being ""Gay"" just because a boy genuinely liked anything female-centric and not interested in merchandise and anything made for your own gender. TV Tropes even has a trope about this called [""Girl-Show Ghetto""](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlShowGhetto).

Craig McCracken's [""The Powerpuff Girls""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MiaSr-0ug) was one of the few exceptions, because while it starred a trio of little girls with super powers. It was actually unisex since both genders of different age groups were deeply in love with the 1998 series since it's an affectionate parody of the entire Super Hero Genre as a whole. There's a reason why McCracken was reportedly pissed when he discovered CN decided to launch a short-lived [Powerpuff Girls fashion line called ""Dream in Style""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95XxUZaF7m8) and why the PPG Reboot gained tons of backlash. As infamous as brony community is. It sure did spawn tons of decent content creators (such as [The Living Tombstone](https://www.youtube.com/@TheLivingTombstone), [Saberspark](https://www.youtube.com/@Saberspark), and [Jenny Nicholson](https://www.youtube.com/@JennyNicholson)) who started out making My Little Pony content before finding their own identity. 


This is why I strongly admire Sanrio since they managed to find way to drawn in other demographic from different gender and ages to a specific Sanrio Character. Such as Aggretsuko, (Sanrio's first adult oriented series) was specifically made teens and young adults (mainly towards grown woman) since it focused on Japanese work culture but managed to find a larger audience when it became a Netflix Series. Before Aggretsuko, Sanrio launched a series called ""Sanrio Boys"" which featured a group of pretty young men who are big fans of Sanrio Characters as a way to make male fans feel more confident of liking anything from the opposite gender. 

I remember five years ago, Sanrio granted the film rights to Hello Kitty to Warner Brothers and New Line Cinema after a five-year courtship [which was first announced on May 2019](https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2019/03/5d1c9b4e3a4d-hello-kitty-to-make-hollywood-debut-in-warner-bros-film.html). [Cut to 2021 when it was revealed to be a live-action/CGI hybrid movie](https://deadline.com/2021/03/hello-kitty-movie-directors-jennifer-coyle-leo-matsuda-new-line-1234704997/) with users giving similar reactions to the announcement as the Barbie Movie did back in 2014. 

Hopefully, Sanrio alongside New Line and Warner Brothers are paying close attention to the amount of positive reception and box office results Barbie gets so they might go all-in on a decently made ""Hello Kitty Movie"" and future films starring Sanrio Characters.",2023-07-21 22:36:04,5,movies,brb1006,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1780,"Just saw this yesterday and loved it. It‚Äôs the best work I‚Äôve ever seen from Robbie and Gosling works overtime to justify his co-billing. In a way, this movie is what happens when you tell a lot of extremely talented and smart creatives to play with their Barbies and their dreamhouses again, and see what happens. If they‚Äôre really putting themselves and their experiences into that sort of playtime (and btw, anyone catch the Jacques Tati references?), you‚Äôre going to see a lifetime of pain and anger emerge. It‚Äôs just the way we humans roll.

It‚Äôs probably the one and only big-budget IP-oriented film that will ever even remotely resemble Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story, which used Barbie dolls to tell a story about sublimated misogyny that was so caustic, all copies of it were ordered destroyed by the courts. Barbie holds out hope here in moving past stereotypes and roles and embracing one‚Äôs humanity, frailty and mortality.

1785,"One thing about this movie I don‚Äôt get is if Goslings Ken is beach Ken meant for Margot Robbie‚Äôs Barbie (and their similar outfits show this as well), then why is Ken like a dumb himbo beach dude but Margot Robbie‚Äôs Barbie is using these elaborate terms like ‚Äúcognitive dissonance‚Äù and quite clever? 
Shouldn‚Äôt she be a bimbo beach Barbie as well?

Seems like because Greta Gerwig wanted to show the Kens as dopey and all the Barbies as empowered and smart there was a big missed opportunity to make the Barbies more fun and interesting. You could have had President Barbie, genius scientist Barbie but also bimbo ‚Äúmath class is hard‚Äù barbie. And there could have been funny moments between barbies. But it seems like most of the Barbies have the same basic personality.

It‚Äôs ironic because I know that was meant to show Barbies and women in a good way and the Kens/men as the Burt of the joke, but it really just made the Barbies kind of bland and boring in their own movie imo. And the worst part is, Margot Robbie‚Äôs Barbie is kind of the most boring one.

Idk seems like it would have been more fun if you had Barbies and Kens all doing different jobs in Barbie land and having different personalities according to their outfits.",2023-07-24 13:14:29,5,movies,NutSackforDayzzzz,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1802,"Sooooo I just watched the movie and luckily all 6 people in the screening didn‚Äôt talk loudly or played with their phones during the movie. Small step for men&women but big win for human kind! 

Loved the movie. Quirky Greta did another wonderful job. Loved all the small details and wonderful messages across the board. Definitely worth a recent rewatch. 

When discussing the movie afterwards me and my SO had the same questions about two specific scenes and their meaning. And I was wondering what other people thought about that.

***** spoilers ahead, as I will be discussing two scenes. The second one is a turning point in the movie, so watch the movie before reading

1. The High School scene
Barbie sees Sasha and wants to approach her. She is stopped by a girl, who basically tells her that Sasha will destroy her, if she talks to her. 

I was completely taken out of the movie by this scene. As I didn‚Äôt understand who that girl was and why she would do what she did. First I thought she was some kind of supervisor to watch over kids so no strangers can approach the children, than I thought she feared Sasha as she described her as kind of a bully/dangerous individual (which she isn‚Äôt, everything Sasha said to Barbie was mean but not without logic). And when Barbie left crying that girl got even more screen time saying something like I told you so. So what exactly did this scene mean and why wasn‚Äôt it left on the cutting room floor? Barbie could have directly approached Sasha and the experience for us viewers would have been the same. Is it just because hey we need a quirky girl for whatever reason.

***big spoiler don‚Äôt read before watching the movie!***

2. Inciting Ken infighting
So the Barbies get rid of the brainwashing of all Barbies and want to initiate an infight between the Kens. All the Barbies go on the exact same date with their respective Kens. Alpha-Kens are self indulgingly playing guitar and ‚Äúeye-banging‚Äù their dates for four hours thinking that is what they want, rather than boosting their own ego with it. This part I get but suddenly all Barbies disturb the play and start to look at their phones and talk about how great another Ken is and just leaves to go to another Ken. Kens get irritated and they plan to destroy the other Kens the next morning.

I‚Äôm probably missing something but even though the Kens are annoying and narcissistic, they don‚Äôt really deserve that treatment, of being left on a date for another person. 

As this was a big turning point in the story, I thought this was a cheap way of setting up the divergence. Especially with alpha-males and toxic masculinity groups and incels talking about how wicked women are, toying with men and stuff. It would make much more sense if the Barbies did something normal/feminist behaviour and the alpha-Kens start to hijack the conversation with their toxic masculinity. If going the jealousy route, something on the line of ‚Äúhey the other Ken is good at *insert proud man hobby* why not let him do it‚Äù. Make it about horses as Beach-Ken loves them. It would make much more sense to resolve this around the tropes of toxic masculinity, than women ‚Äúmanipulating‚Äù men with jealousy. Now you gave all the edgelords, alpha males and incels reason to say, look this is how women manipulate us.


So please tell me that we were wrong and we just couldn‚Äôt see the hidden layer of this scene!

Every shot with that car frames it in perfect profile like a commercial and it‚Äôs really annoying. I‚Äôm surprised not to see more people pointing out the obvious product placement.

1814,"When this movie was first announced to be happening I thought it was a really dumb idea. However once Greta Gerwig attached herself to this and Margot Robbie was casted I became intrigued. This is probably the most pleasantly surprised I‚Äôve been after seeing a movie since The Lego Movie In 2014 I guess all the hype online surrounding this turned out to be worth it. 

Now that‚Äôs not to say this is a perfect movie, it‚Äôs not. The first act for me dragged and the movie only started to get good for me once Barbie and Ken entered the real world. The performances here were great across the board. Margot Robbie fits into this role like a glove like seriously I can‚Äôt picture any other actress doing this role as good as she did here. I find it funny that now whenever people think of Margot Robbie the first two things that come to mind for probably most people are now Harley Quinn and Barbie. Ryan Gosling who is one of my favorite actors is also really good here so much so that he arguably steals this movie away from Robbie at times. If you watched Crazy Stupid Love and The Nice Guys you would know that Gosling has great comedic chops and they are on full display here. Will Ferrell essentially has the same role here as he did in The Lego Movie but if I‚Äôm being honest I thought Phil Lord and Chris Miller were able to use him better in that compared to what Gerwig did with him here. Also shoutout to Michael Cera who had a small but effective role here. 

Greta Gerwig herself is now 3/3 with Lady Bird, Little Women and now this. Hopefully she‚Äôs able to keep her winning streak going. With the way this movie ends I‚Äôm not sure how a sequel would work exactly. However what I do hope happens is we get a Ken spin-off movie after the likely success of this and honestly how could we not.

Having a himbo character is always fun but that got over done too that it just stopped being funny. Not much development, besides the real world sucking, but then Barbie liking that, then the last joke to close the film really took away from whatever message they were trying to hammer in.
Some jokes I laughed, but a lot were misses. Maybe because I‚Äôm quite young my humor didn‚Äôt click with more millennial humor? I don‚Äôt think this film is gonna age well by the end of the year or a year after like other movies that had strong hype only to be disliked later on.

1845,"I thought it could have been better. The first part was really great- depicted how I played with a Barbie when I was younger really perfectly! There was a perfect mashup of introduction, comedy, fashion, and just overall pink vibes. I was really excited for Barbie to go to the real world and battle the patriarchy and was surprised to see the plot go in a different way. It went from mother-daughter relationships to the patriarchy to fragile masculinity? 

I mean, I understood what the director was trying to do- but she just shoved so much things in that didn‚Äôt get resolved at all. Sasha and her mom suddenly had a good relationship, the patriarchy was resolved only in Barbie land and there was barely anything that helped the real world, and the whole Ken thing was‚Ä¶. It just felt like it was spreading the wrong message- that men want power because they don‚Äôt like being rejected??? Because they can‚Äôt cry??? Because they don‚Äôt feel appreciated enough??? I don‚Äôt know. It just felt like they skimmed over each ideas and didn‚Äôt really delve into them. There were some good points but it didn‚Äôt seem to go anywhere. Maybe I was expecting too much from the movie. 

And the whole thing about the cellulites, to the pregnant Barbie, to Barbie constantly saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ugly, no one likes me!‚Äù, and the whole masculinity belongs to men and femininity belongs to women felt kind of‚Ä¶ eh to me. Like the whole felt SO CLOSE to talking about feminism and taking apart the patriarchy and misogyny but it just never went there. The ending just felt kind of rushed too- like I expected Barbie to become a ‚Äúhelper-Barbie‚Äù and decide to go to the human world to help the women there. But she just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. 

But the comedy was on point and there were still some golden moments. It‚Äôs a good start for people who don‚Äôt really understand the patriarchy/feminism- in a fun way! I feel like I was just expecting a lot and the film didn‚Äôt do justice for my excitement?

1848,"I think this movie offers a delightful fantasy experience with its clever satire, attention to detail, and intriguing outer and inner story arcs. While the second act had some flaws and occasional pacing issues, overall, the movie succeeds in captivating both teen and adult audiences alike. The portrayal of Barbie's self-discovery journey and the message of acceptance and empathy resonate well. Despite a few minor drawbacks, the movie manages to keep viewers entertained throughout. It's a refreshing take on the iconic character, reminding us of the importance of embracing life's complexities and finding beauty in both its highs and lows.

**There‚Äôs one line in the movie that I didn‚Äôt catch that I have been thinking about recently. That specific line was said by the voice-over, which I think was Helen Mirren (?), that mentioned something about Margot Robbie as an actress.

1863,"34F - Figured out why I didn‚Äôt like Barbie

Anyone of similar age remember going to see Mean Girls in theaters?  Remember walking out super stressed/anxious?  Remember hating the movie?

It came out when I was still in High School and I remember going to see it with my girlfriends - we drove ourselves, so we had to be 16/17 - we all left kinda hating the movie and feeling really stressed - it‚Äôs because it was far to dang real! It wasn‚Äôt a comedy - it was an intensely horrifying documentary ü§£ (love the movie now that I‚Äôm far removed from HS)

Anyhow - I think that‚Äôs why I left Barbie feeling the same - it‚Äôs far to fricken real for me - the last company I was at was 90% white, straight, married men and they treated me horrifically (i.e. I spoke up about some math we were a little over zealous on and potentially going to lose customers over if they found out we were full of crap - only to have my manager say ‚Äúwell. You‚Äôre just wrong.‚Äù ‚Ä¶ and a second direct quote: ‚Äúif you weren‚Äôt a woman, you‚Äôd be fired by now‚Äù which was a follow-up statement to the convo: ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm treated differently because I‚Äôm the only female on the team‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre female‚Äù)

I gave up on everything/life for a minute >!just like Barbie did!< and became really depressed >!again, just like Barbie!< - it was a really rough time in my life and it was barely 6 months ago that the f-ers laid me off after being miserable working for them for a year and a half - so Barbie is just a little too real for me right now (hopefully I grow to enjoy it like with Mean Girls because I did still laugh quite a bit!! >!Weird Barbie was the best ü§£ü§£ü§£ my sister and I definitely had one of those and she was indeed always in the splits!<)

Figured I‚Äôd share since a lot folks saying they didn‚Äôt like the movie are getting labeled as ‚Äúmust hate women‚Äù ‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs not the case with me - so likely not the case with others, too! üòÅ

1865,"i don‚Äôt understand why some people are SO CRITIC about the film‚Ä¶

for me it‚Äôs just a film that shows idiocracy of the world and pointing out important things in a silly manner:

1. how easy it is to convince people to follow certain ideology

*Ken came back to barbieland*

- it‚Äôs patriarchy now

*people followed without questioning*

- okay

*barbie came back to barbieland*

- fuck patriarchy 

*people AGAIN followed without questioning*

2. how many men are JUST friends, instead of boyfriends and that females need to see that and comprehend, instead of taking it for granted

3. females also DO HATE other females and that is what is similar between men and women

4. stereotypical dating experience for females, like: playing the guitar, or how come you not see god father (that one really got meü§£üóø)

5. women-oriented brands (whose target audience are FEMALES) are ruled mostly by men

6. power can be even with skirt and heels 

7. things won‚Äôt change until WE as FEMALES will start changing things ourselves

8. life is constantly changing and we cannot do anything about it 

9. how hard it is to be a mom, with maintaining her own happiness and being a good mom

1878,"Thinking about it some more, I can respect and appreciate and acknowledge that the main message of the film is about womanhood and was made for the target audience of film for female viewers and not male viewers.

So as a male viewer, maybe that is why I‚Äôm looking at all of the other plot points and simply can‚Äôt see the main one?

I just don‚Äôt feel like the two main points of the message weren‚Äôt as impactful (America Ferrera + Rita Perlman) as they could have been, but maybe it‚Äôs because it was done in a calm non-reaction based tone? I guess that is why I‚Äôm admittedly confused.

1882,"I (34/M) did the Barbenheimer experience. Saw Oppenheimer (loved it) and then saw Barbie. I go to a lot of movies and I have never been in a theatre with so many women. Especially young women.

I liked the movie. Greta Gerwig is fun. There are lots of laughs, and I was impressed at how many bullets Mattell agreed to take. There is definitely some self-awareness in this movie. I know there are lots of complaints about it being too preachy but I would disagree. I thought there was good balance between entertainment and not taking itself too seriously with a good amount of feminist message. I wouldn‚Äôt say it was the tightest script, and I think the themes got a little bit messy in spots, but overall a good fun popcorn flick with some intelligence.",2023-07-25 07:35:48,4,movies,Studly_Wonderballs,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

1884,"I liked the movie. I didn't love it for several reasons, but manly because it dragged a little with the Mattel HQ and the Ken storylines. Margot was the best and I wish she got more airtime and that Barbie's storyline didn't revolve so much around Ken. In some parts they tried too hard to be funny but as charming as Ryan can be, Ken's part was a little to much. I get that he's an asshole and that serves many of the arguments of the movie, but my problem is that the movie tries to convince us that his bad behaviour is funny and it mostly isn't (while also passing Barbie's distress as kind of a joke sometimes? :/).
I also think the mom and daughter were a little wasted potential. The movie plot exists because of the connection between Barbie and the mother and it feels as if that plot was discarded halfway in favor of Ken's shenanigans. There were parts I was asking myself why there were so many men talking? But maybe that's on purpose to mirror real life?
In the end, I think the movie succeds in being a conversation starter. It's not an easy movie to make and interpretate and that is good. It's subtle and heavy handed at the same time and it tries to balance a lot. It was impossible not to deal with gender if you wanted the movie to reflect the legacy of Barbie and its impact on women and women's rights, and the movie is successful in this.
I liked the ending conversation with Ruth, (the creator) a lot, and the fact that Barbie turned from a reactive character to someone with agency. Wish we had a little more of those moments instead of empty song and dance numbers (I'm a fan of musicals but these were mostly boring to me). Sets, costuming, hair and makeup do deserve awards for their fantastic work.",2023-07-25 12:46:26,4,movies,oquiquo,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

And then we have the analogy level, where it's talking about patriarchy, society, and manhood and womanhood.

And sometimes the Kens were analogies for manhood and sometimes analogies for how women are treated in the Real World. So, opposite things. And I just couldn't always tell when they were switching.

Both films are about the relations between men and women. Shoot is considerably more darker, it's just that Barbie glosses over the more negative aspects of the patriarchy. You'll see women who do the same things in Barbie to take control of the system where in Shoot it's just to survive. The fact that Shoot has several insults where (women and men) are ""once you've seen one you've seen them all"", with the more literal form of that with Barbie. And how Barbie primes you to see the women in Shoot differently, i.e. why their lives seemingly revolve around men, than if Shoot were on its own.

1931,"This movie was such an interesting meditation on symbols. I kept thinking about some of the opening lines of Guy Debord's Society of the Spectacle:
  
""In societies where modern conditions of production prevail, all of life presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles...Reality considered partially unfolds, in its own general unity, as a pseudo-world apart, an object of mere contemplation. The specialization of images of the world is completed in the world of the autonomous image, where the liar has lied to himself. The spectacle in general, as the concrete inversion of life, is the autonomous movement of the non-living...The spectacle presents itself simultaneously as all of society, as part of society, and as instrument of unification. As a part of society it is specifically the sector which concentrates all gazing and all consciousness.""
  
A pseudo-world apart, where the non-living operates autonomously, presenting itself as both how the world is and how it could/should be, and which sustains its existence through objectification?

1937,"Great cast, great sets and really funny movie.

Movie is also very political, which given that Barbie had such a large cultural (often controversial) impact makes sense. So my comment below is going to be on the political message:

I'm sorry women still feel forced/pushed by society to meeting these expectations of them that are unachievable because the expectations themself are mutually exclusive (mentioned in speech by the mom towards the end). Being who you are as a person should be enough (Barbie telling old woman on bench she's beautiful). And that men to this day often don't understand that women don't owe them anything (ken coming to grips with it not being barbie &ken, but just barbie, and ken). These are clearly themes that still resonate and it's important to address them.

The world is still male centric in many ways and to show this imbalance the movie uses the topic of supreme court seats. However, by not giving Ken a single seat on the supreme court at the end, because Barbie wants to match the inequality she saw in the real world, the movie suggests that the power balance towards men is 9-0. Which it just isn't. It's 6-3 if you want to use supreme court seats as representation. So we aren't at equality yet and we should keep fighting for equality, but inequality in todays ""patriarchy"" as they call it in the movie isn't at 9-0 levels.

And I think that's kind of where you lose the message as a movie and things become a bit heavy handed for my taste",2023-07-31 08:28:06,2,movies,userAsklepi0s,comment,Official Discussion - Barbie [SPOILERS]

In the end, not every movie has to be made for everyone. There are plenty of movies that are feel good movies for men and this was definitely a feel good movie for women. I think that if you are secure in your own version of masculinity you won‚Äôt have a problem watching this movie and enjoying it.

SUBLIME!

Edit: Forgot to mention, the ending is actually a really positive message for men. Ken is all down trodden because Barbie doesn‚Äôt love him and she has a nice piece about how Ken can just be who is and like what he likes. His having or not having a girlfriend doesn‚Äôt determine his value and that he is intrinsically valuable by just being himself.

10,"I honestly didn't see the movie as Anti-Men at all. Obviously is a movie that centers around women's feelings and experience in the society, I mean, is a movie about Barbie. The men are used simply as a plot point to develop the women in the movie and there is nothing wrong with It, but i feel safe to say that the Ken(s) and Allan have better character depth and development that many movies made and targeted towards other men. 

plus the movie approach to maternity I think it will appeal to anyone. After one specific scene I felt the need to call my mom, I am living abroad and I don't see and talk to her as much as I used to. This theme was treated with such sensitivity that I was pleasant surprised.

You may dislike the movie and disagree with their argument, but trust me that it will not start misandric revolution on society. 

In the end I think women, in this point, are better than us in the aspect of making movies discussing women's experience, feelings, emotions and its struggles. I love come-of-age movies and most of them are about a young woman discovering herself, we lack some that discusses a young boys' experience and that is mostly our fault. We don't have interest in produce neither in watch it.

Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling crushed their parts. 10/10 acting. The plot was kinda all over the place and there were a number of scenes that honestly didn‚Äôt need to be in the movie.

16,"Spoilers below:


I thought it was a funny movie, and I laughed at a bunch of parts (especially when they broke the 4th wall). Overall, I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan though. I didn‚Äôt like the message. 

The first and second act seemed like it was going in the right direction. A reverse and exaggerated version of todays world. In the Barbie world, women are the (for lack of a better term) dominant group and the men were the subservient group. The main Ken somehow reversed that and the Barbies realized what it‚Äôs like to be on the other side. 

They then went and manipulated and tricked the Kens into essentially reversing the power balance back to how it was before. I was expecting the Barbies to learn the lesson now that they felt what it was like on the other side, but no, they went right back to how it was. When the kens asked to have a presence in their Supreme Court (or senate, I don‚Äôt remember what the leadership group was called in the movie) the laughed at that idea, and said they‚Äôd basically throw them a bone and give them one lower level leadership position. Nobody (except maybe the main barbie) learned their lesson. Nothing was resolved. 

Imagine if the genders were reversed, there would be outrage over that movie. 

Like I said, it had funny parts and I don‚Äôt regret watching it, but I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of how it ended. It was better than Oppenheimer though.",2023-07-23 16:51:47,176,AskMen,heatdish1292,comment,"Men who have watched Barbie, what did you think about the movie?"

18,"I give it a 7/10. I thought it was funny and entertaining. The whole ""nobody cares about Ken"" thing wasn't supposed to be a personal jab at Ken/men, but the fact that nobody really cares about the Ken doll. I think parts of the plot could have been handled better to help the message though.  


Before I go onto my criticism of the movie, I understand that the movie doesn't need to be for everyone and that the focus should be on Barbie, not Ken. However, the one issue I took with it is that parts of the plot hinder the intended message. Barbie experiences what it's like to be a 2nd class citizen like what Ken experiences in the Barbie world. Instead of taking her experiences and improving the Barbie world for everyone including Ken (who is seemingly homeless), they continue a system of making Ken 2nd class. The line that really drove this home is when one of the Kens asked if they can have a seat on the supreme court and they were told no and given a much lower position instead. That struck me as continuing the status quo of ""Ken is 2nd class"" and justifying their system.   


Instead of Ken bringing the patriarchy to the Barbie world, why not make a sub plot where he goes on a journey of discovering he can be more than just beach Ken? That appears briefly near the end anyways. Just make it more of a focus. It'd be parallel to women's historical journey of becoming more than just the roles they have been historically given.",2023-07-23 18:17:46,155,AskMen,pale_green_pants,comment,"Men who have watched Barbie, what did you think about the movie?"

21,"I saw it last night, and I've had some time to digest it.

Without going into the obvious exploration of feminism and patriarchal society - because that's most of what people are going to talk about - the movie ends up somewhere different than that. The ending really nailed it, and that's where it could have went wrong.

The 'message' of the movie was finding value and worth in yourself, and not in external perceptions of you. It was a movie about agency and self-worth. As it explored themes throughout the movie it ends up with ""who are you and what do you want out of life"" - and I felt like it was intentionally a movie for everyone. Not just women who grew up in our societies - historically having less power and agency than men.

I also think it will be treated very dismissively by many people who can't open their minds enough to have their worldview challenged, and many folks are going to put up walls to not fully hear the themes and resolution out. The takes that it is just feminist woke propaganda are such shit takes, because you have to be really narrow minded to only see that in the movie's themes - even more so to not 'agree' with feminism and the existance of a patriarchy.

If Ken would have been the big bad guy who gets punished for his actions in the end then it would have fallen flat. In Barbie Land Ken wasn't shown respect, and he had no value or self worth. Barbie acknowledges how she made him feel, and that it wasn't out of malice. She encourages him to love himself and become the best person he can be for himself - not for how others see him or feel about him. The role reversal between Barbie Land and the Real World was handled so well.

TL;DR - I loved it. Ultimately it is a film about personal agency and finding value in yourself - not tying your self-worth to society or other person's perception of you.",2023-07-23 21:26:32,137,AskMen,g-o-o-b-e-r,comment,"Men who have watched Barbie, what did you think about the movie?"

There were a few scenes in act 2 and 3 with Ken that made me proud to be a man tbh.
It made some points about the patriarchy that were technically accurate but nothing surprising or new.

Some spoilers ahead 

I think it was interesting that Barbie land was the role reversal of the real world but I feel like a lot of the messages can be confusing because of that. Like at the end the Women just kinda deviously manipulated the men to regain power and they were portrayed as the ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù while the men all became friends and had unity but were technically the antagonists? Idk if the message was muddled? I think at the end it was just like Men are Men and Women are Women and neither is meant to be dependent on the other or something but I think it depends on your interpretation. The points 

I think the plot was also kinda all over the place. I did think it was interesting that Barbie had like the opposite of their intended effect in the real world but the real world didn‚Äôt even matter much in the plot?? Halfway through.

37,"There's a lot to carry for the writers. Barbie's origin, (strange they went with a History of the World/Mel Brooks/masturbating apes remake, or 2001 a Space Odyssey on which that scene was based), but with little white girls with baby dolls). There's the fact that Barbie was modeled after a literal hooker, and how Ruth overcame the sexualization of the female form as child's plaything- by morphing Barbie (a name borrowed from her own child Barbara) into something aspirational. This led of course to the decades of Barbie's as careers, reinforcing the notion that women can do/be anything. Again, for the writers, this is a lot of material. The Barbie/Ken dynamic needs to be addressed. Who exactly is Ken? What is the relationship between them? How does that relationship fit into the independent woman narrative? How does Ken feel about this? The use/abuse of the dolls, (Kate McKinnon's markered/haircut/legspread Barbie was fantastic). Pregnant Barbie. (Yes, that was a real doll). The writers stayed true to Barbie's story, her essence, her transitions through the years, yet her 'stereotypical' self. The handling of Barbie's Land- ala Lego Batman was good writing. Barbie, as seen through the eyes of the girls who play with them- allowed us to connect to the doll as we did when we were children. Margo Robbie falling over from a sitting position- omg. All in all, the brand here had so much to offer. The writers carried it all through a (mostly) cohesive story. The film is a joy- once you decide to accept 'movie magic' and just let yourself go with it. (At one point, a ghost has a conversation with a doll, in... Heaven?) It's fun, it's real, it's fake. Gosling's Kendom is the stereotypical boy's version of the playset, which allows us to see insights into gender reversals- which is poignant for anyone, of any gender, or any age. 
The fact that self titled 'alpha-males' are crying over this film for little girls, is even funnier than most of the jokes in this film. Maybe they too should go visit their gynocologists.",2023-07-23 16:46:09,47,AskMen,,comment,"Men who have watched Barbie, what did you think about the movie?"

What really shocked me was how in the movie, they highlighted how being a feminist doesn't mean you should neglect the men supporting you in life and vice versa.  It clearly stated there are strengths to be found in both masculinity and femininity and neither side is weak, but damaging in extremes. 

Margot Robbie showed an impressive range of emotions they borderline on an Oscar-worthy performance, but Ryan Gosling really resonated with what I imagine a lot of men feel in their relationships or friendships with the fairer sex.

I get that Barbie had an uphill battle, but the filmmakers felt the need to over explain the message instead of using clever scriptwriting to introduce nuisance. Maybe it was because it was a ‚Äúkids‚Äù movie with adult themes, but I felt like it was too dumbed down for the audience. When the scriptwriter feels the need to use ‚Äúpatriarchy‚Äù 10 times, there‚Äôs an issue. 

But the ending to me could have been a lot better. There was little character arc for the Barbie‚Äôs and Ken‚Äôs. They all reverted to where they started, re-establishing the patriarchy they swore to disband. At least it wasn‚Äôt men running things this time‚Ä¶

I think it sends the wrong message to our youths. Women are better than men at most positions of leadership. Men are stupid and should be given lowly positions. Isn‚Äôt this how we‚Äôve treated women in the past? Isn‚Äôt the whole critique of our modern world?

The Barbies (except Margot‚Äôs character) all represent a concept or idea. This is interesting because historically, women were seen as the muses, and men the creators/artists.

So Barbie (Margot) is not satisfied to be the muse anymore (‚ÄúI want to be the one imagining, not the idea‚Äù).

As to the feminist messages, I don't think there was anything controversial. I dont think there was anything all that new or insightful either. It all just felt very obvious and surprising that anyone would need to hear it. I think right-wing men just can't stand hearing the word patriarchy or seeing men portrayed as dumb or ridiculous. If you're a man and this is the first time you're ""understanding feminisim"" then you're either very young or been living under a rock for the last 30 years. 

During the mom's big monologue speech in Weird Barbie's house I did wonder, though, who is telling women they have to feel that way? Sometimes, I feel like women are just torturing each other with their own fears and expectations. Also, I think men could have a similar monologue about how confusing and hard it is to be men in our modern world.

96,"I had fun watching this movie. Great entertainment. As Stanley Kubrick is my favourite director, I loved the homages.

As for social commentary, I think Barbie world initially an inverse of the real world. Only women gets to be in important positions and no one knows where kens live. Barbies with imperfections would be called weird. In real world too, initially patriarchy exists and until recent times, men have been in charge and they hold important positions. However, they are expected to be the leader of the family, become the bread earner, not showing vulnerability, not expressing themselves that would not be considered masculine,putting on a strong facade against all odds etc. In the Barbie, we see it from the perspective of women. They are expected to be perfect at all times, how they should behave, how they can't be fat and have to be in shape, how they can't age etc. Now the world is changing. In the Barbie movie, kens are getting jobs at intermediary level, Barbie's are not expected to be perfect at all times. I understand that many people may find this movie to promote matriarchy but it is actually a metaphor for change of power dynamics in real world. Most men can't feel this way because this is told from the perspective of women. Also, the ones who are saying story could have been told without using men as plot points, didn't we use women for the same reasons for years now. Now that perspective has been changed, you may experience cognitive dissonance but give it time.

117,"I watched the film the day it released and was really excited to watch it, I think Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwich are good writers and the film had an excellent cast so I had very high expectations.

I had no issues with the message of the movie and didn't find it to be anti-men as some are claiming it to be.

I just didn't enjoy the film as I thought it was poorly written and didn't find it funny at all, the pacing of the film was a mess and it felt like a first semester film school student wrote the script.

To my surprise everyone thinks the film is hilarious which I find really surprising, maybe I'm dead inside or maybe I have a different sense of humour.

Greta Gerwig (and everyone involved including producer and star Margo Robbie) threaded a very delicate needle absolutely perfectly. I thought they did an excellent job of humanizing the Kens, and in the end it is the patriarchy itself which is the true bad guy, not the Kens themselves. Did they take obvious and fair shots at things like mansplaining? Absolutely, but the jokes honestly felt fair and I never felt even a little bit attacked or offended. I laughed so hard and even cried a little at parts. Great film, can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying this but I can‚Äôt wait to re-watch it when it comes to streaming.

128,"I like how it exposed corporate executives as what they actually are. I like that it showed how Barbie as a product has alienated some women from childhood.

I liked the message that men shouldn't define themselves by whatever woman they're attracted to or obsess over her and find their own way, as this is something I learned the hard way years ago and it made my life substantially better. I didn't like how it glossed over how Barbie was not once clear with Ken about her feelings towards (i.e. friendship) him until the very end AND framed it as being his fault.

I don't like how it framed all women who like to be more submissive as brainwashed. At one point I think it was the president Barbie who says something about how it's relaxing to not have to make decisions for a while. It's a common BDSM dynamic, that sub space is a relaxing escape from responsibility even if the exterior appearance is otherwise. There are both men and women (and other) subs, and from my experience in the community this feeling is common to most of them. 

I also didn't like how it glorified emotional manipulation as a way to get what you want. I had an ex who would pull that shit to get me to dislike my friends and isolate me. It didn't work, but some guys aren't very close with their friends and isolating someone is one of the first steps of abuse.",2023-07-25 16:38:28,3,AskMen,OperationIntrudeN313,comment,"Men who have watched Barbie, what did you think about the movie?"

131,"Honestly, it's probably a movie that I'll remember for the rest of my life. 

The beginning disturbed me more than any horror movie. I consider myself pretty desensitized but the beginning montage was overwhelming. >!The 'enlightenment' of little girls before a living Barbie idol and their smashing of their old toys!< horrified me. >!The montage of thousands of living barbies, all with different skin colors but otherwise exactly the same!< was square in the uncanny valley, and the earnestness of it all made it far worse.

Barbie's existential crisis is a fun concept and I really like how they did those parts. >!Sasha's beratement of Barbie as a fascist!< was ridiculous. I get that the movie is Mattel's addressing of grievances, but given everything that America going through with actual fascism, it pulled me out of the movie. 

Lots of camp, lots of political heavy-handedness. The Kens' beach battle was the best part imo, and >!Barbie's talk with her creator!< completed the story in a satisfying way. Even got a few tears out of me. 

I wouldn't call it fun, but an experience of something totally beyond my knowledge--like an acid trip that leaves you changed. I'm glad I went, but I won't be going back for seconds. 

On that note, as far as anyone who feels their masculinity hurt by Barbie, all I'll say that Ken's version of masculinity is about as realistic as Megan Foxs' version of femininity in Transformers. It's a choice to see this as ""what women want"", and it's a choice to be upset by it.",2023-07-24 05:47:34,3,AskMen,Chinaroos,comment,"Men who have watched Barbie, what did you think about the movie?"

133,"Altogether a good movie that left me with a lot of things to think about. 

It's kind of like that flashback that Anton Ego has in Ratatouille, but not for any of my personal memories ‚Äî it's more just disarming me of the day-to-day illusive overfamiliarity with the world as it appears to be, and putting me face-to-face with the bare soul of a scared, confused, overwhelmed, heartbroken person that happens to be a woman in today's age.

Probably an awful articulation of how it resonated with me, but it's like the Christmas truce during World War 1. Guns laid down and emptied out. Snowballs, candy bars, cigarettes.

Because the world outside the theater ‚Äî that we all happen to live in ‚Äî kind of feels like a stage-play where men are systematically pitted against women, and vice versa, in a lot of different ways. 

But we're just clueless human animals who inherited the infrastructure and social contracts of our grandparents, in an exceedingly bittering world that's being set on fire, and this outrageous fighting we're all doing ‚Äî so much of it's just trained into us. Role-play we take so seriously until we actually believe it.

It's weird to say, but the movie legitimately made me tear up at parts. Some things felt like a cold splash of water in the face (in a good way), and others were pretty campy and enjoyable.

Ken was a pretty neat character but it seemed as if he was dismissed and made the butt of the joke and brushed off for attention purposes. It was in sort of a playful manner.

170,"As a kid of the 90s I mostly enjoyed it. Thought there were plenty of funny moments and Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling really hit a home run with how they brought Barbie and Ken to life. The dance scenes and overall performances, especially in the first third of the movie, were really well executed. However I did find that I left the film a bit confused. I was expecting a light and fun story throughout but it did get a bit dreary in places with a lot of mixed messages and unanswered questions. 

Like I still don‚Äôt know if Barbies are meant to empower women or make them feel bad about themselves? Did the all male Mattel board actually learn anything or did they just steal Gloria‚Äôs idea for a new Barbie at the end? Where do the Ken‚Äôs live? 

There were also some other confusing messages. Like when the Ken‚Äôs were being stereotypical toxic men, the plan of attack of the Barbies, despite having just saved all the the intelligent ones, was simply gaslighting and emotion manipulation. A bit of a let down that the Barbies just went straight towards reclaiming their lost power through more toxic behaviour when there was a perfect opportunity for reflection and attempts at equality.

While the message was a bit of a miss for me, the aesthetics and production were top notch. The actual set design and look and feel of Barbie world felt pretty unique. And I loved the little quips and nods to things like 2001: A Space Odyssey, depression Barbie and Sugar Daddy. Overall, I feel it was a good movie, quite enjoyable however, if they leant more into what makes Barbie fun, alongside a very clear message, it would‚Äôve flowed better and been worthy of a re-watch. Just fell a little short.

174,"I liked it. It was preachy in certain scenes but considering  it was through the lens of Barbie that the storyline was written it was good. 
HE IS KEN

Ken was the highlight of the film and the way in which they highlighted the fact that he felt like he didn't matter in Barbie land and then when he came to the real world and found out about patriarchy and took it back home to Barbieland, he felt like he mattered. Also loved the way they ended his arc. 
HE IS KENOUGH!!!

Some of those lines while the barbies are trying to irk the kens to make them start fighting kinda felt like a little bit of generalization of what all men are supposed to be like but also at the same time it made me think as to how I was behaving with Women as well. Or those lines could just be about how patriarchal men think and also kinda call them out. 

The ending however felt a little bit out of place as I tried to relate to the woes of Margot's Barbie with Ruth. 

I thoroughly enjoyed the film tho!!",2023-07-24 21:01:50,2,AskMen,Few_Butterscotch_832,comment,"Men who have watched Barbie, what did you think about the movie?"

182,"Was great fun! (spoilers)

Saw an advanced screening and was laughing with my wife throughout the entire adventure. Our audience was awesome as well.  Great energy, great camera work, great pacing, great soundtrack.  Still waiting on everyone to notice that they sampled ‚ÄúSnap! I‚Äôve Got The Power‚Äù for the theme song.

With the SNL cast, I felt there was a missed opportunity not having Kristen Wiig as one of the Barbie‚Äôs tho.  ‚ÄúOh Barbie!!‚Äù Maybe next time.

I even shed a few tears at the end as the final talk between Ruth and Barbie was beautiful and well executed.  As a parent, when watching the characters have a direct and frank discussion about life and being human, it hits harder.  I want more of these scenarios in pop movies.  Loved the sequence of old family videos and indie filmmaker imagery montage.

I don‚Äôt know why everyone is having a cow about the patriarchy nonsense.  If people actually watch it til the end, they would have heard Ruth say point blank that the patriarchy is fake- It‚Äôs all made up!  It‚Äôs a great scene actually.

So yes, just watch it, have fun, and stop getting radicalized by the internet.

213,"Though reviews of the films were almost universally positive, I certainly wasn't expecting a beautiful, emotionally-engaging hero's journey when I bought tickets for ""Barbie"". Margot Robbie really was the perfect choice for the lead role, as her range brought a lot of nuance and emotion to the character.  


It was a lot funnier than I anticipated, as the trailer made me a little worried about the use of more cringey humor. Ryan Gosling's performance as a loveable himbo definitely stole the show. >!Seriously, ""I am Kenough"", Ruth's tax evasion, and all the tongue-in-cheek self-awareness had me and my theater dying!!<

236,"I (42m) went with my wife (37f) and daughter (17f) for my daughter‚Äôs 17th birthday.  This movie was very poorly done and a huge missed opportunity for the writers, directors, and the Barbie brand. 

All three of us were stunned by how illogical, sexist, and insultingly anti-men the movie was.  The number of unnecessary scenes and pointless or insulting dialogue was mind-boggling.  Yes, I realize it was a movie about a toy line and I wasn‚Äôt expecting Citizen Cane, but it was shockingly bad. 

Walking out of the theatre we overheard at least two young women comment as to how terrible the movie was. 

Personally, as a man, I felt attacked. My wife felt it necessary (it wasn‚Äôt) to let me know, jokingly, that she does not think of me as some sort of controlling misogynist despite being a successful professional who provides for my family, our kids, and my ex-wife. Apparently I am not oppressing her by having attended university before we met, despite the fact that she made a different choice at the same age, and my life choices (shockingly) did not have any impact on hers until we met and chose to be together. 

The message of the movie was at best confusing and at worst insulting of our intelligence.  For example, (i) the Mattel Board of Directors in real life is 50% women and all highly accomplished and educated people, (ii) the solution to ‚Äúoppression‚Äù is not for the oppressors figure out how to subjugate their oppressors, and (iii) despite the writers/director‚Äôs attempt to imply that post-secondary education is a tool of misogyny in our society, the reality is that 60-65% of students in every western university are women. 

I can say that (i) Ryan Gosling validly deserves an Oscar for this movie, (ii) the first 40 minutes of the movie we‚Äôre rather entertaining and set up a movie universe that could have been the basis for a very entertaining movie. They lost me, and my family, when the movie tried to manufacture a social commentary based on lies and a horribly bastardized version of third-wave feminism.

Edit:  The Ken‚Äôs were not a gender swapped 1950s. The Kens were accessories to the Barbies, because these were TOYS, and they acted out against it. Suggesting that gender roles in the the 1950s involved women being accessories to men is both wrong and horribly insulting to women.",2023-07-24 04:59:35,1,AskMen,rain_maker4321,comment,"Men who have watched Barbie, what did you think about the movie?"

Like ive been to all the big marvel movies, harry potter midnight premieres, the dark knight trilogy blah blah. Ive had a bunch of great moments.

I loved the Ken storyline, especially liked that they didnt make Barbie accept his love at the end and in fact they both ended up being okay with being themselves rather than being dependant on eachother. Screw the people whinging about the smash the patriarchy plotline because that is the reality, and denying that just shows wilful ignorance. Ken becoming an andrew tate style 'alpha male' was a hilarious parody of this.

I‚Äôve seen posts, comments, and articles on a variety of different social media platforms/forums from men who think Barbie is misandrist assault on them, though I believe those who have that interpretation have poor media literacy.

The personalities and demeanor of the Barbie and Ken characters intentionally highlighted the characteristics young girls would impose upon Barbie and Ken dolls when playing with them, that includes Ken simply being an accessory to Barbie, not Ken being equally as important. There are many parts in Barbie that are clearly indicative of my point, such as Barbie having many different personas and occupations, but Ken is just ‚ÄúKen‚Äù; for example, Ken saying his job is ‚Äúbeach‚Äù overtly conveys the point that a young girl isn‚Äôt putting much thought into Ken‚Äôs backstory.",2023-07-24 00:47:32,1,AskMen,DrBusiness1,comment,"Men who have watched Barbie, what did you think about the movie?"

307,"Ken was fine, his story/arc made sense to me. I was a little confused about what they were trying to say about the husband.

Minor spoilers below:

When they talk about leaving the dad behind to go to Barbieland, the movie cuts to him practicing to speak his wife and daughter's native language - which strikes me as sweet and admirable - but seemed to be played for laughs, depicting him as basically a non-entity. Later, at the end of the movie, he attempts to speak Spanish, and gets corrected by his wife and scolded by his daughter.

The second moment was during the car chase, the daughter asks ""how did you learn to drive like that ... from dad?"" And the mom has a look on her face when she replies ""yeah, from dad,"" strongly implying it was *not* dad/her husband - the implication being .... what?

Neither of these ruins the movie, it just a perpetuation of the clueless dad/husband trope that appears so often.",2023-07-24 02:02:16,1,AskMen,Modo_de_Jogo,comment,"Men who have watched Barbie, what did you think about the movie?"

There were certainly standout scenes that I thought were excellent, but many of the positive or empowering messages felt very, ""let me tell you my problem"" which is a way to get your point across, but it's... kinda grating? The original speech that deprogrammed them felt really on the nose as well, and in general some of it really fell flat for me.

Obviously the movie wasn't aimed at me, but my mother who went with me also seemed to feel similarly annoyed with the film's lack of tact.

The scenes where they had fun with the barbie concept was easily my favorite parts, and the premise seemed good.

The plot was kinda all over the place, but personally the absurd humor was my exact type of humor so it made up for it in my book. If that type of humor isn't your bag I can see how it'd fall flat, but ultimately it's much more of a comedy than a social commentary so that's too be expected.",2023-08-07 04:29:24,1,AskMen,Shrekquille_Oneal,comment,"Men who have watched Barbie, what did you think about the movie?"

331,"Like:
- how direct it is to present day issues
- ‚ÄúI‚Äôm equally balanced in terms of logic and emotion‚Äù.
- the moment when Barbie is acclimating to the real world, laughs when someone else laughs and compliments the old lady calling her beautiful (reminded me of when I found myself and was hopeful becuase I was feeling things for the first time. Kind of lost that hope I‚Äôll ever be able to feel that strongly for a sustained period again).
- all the weird vintage barbies
- The surprisingly awesome set designs 
- The ‚Äúwomen have to be this, be that‚Äù speech by American Ferrara (some of that speech I don‚Äôt think applies to just women or is true m, but much of it is true and  mcuts through so much bullshit about what we do to ourselves as a society with the narrow boxes we put ourselves in)
- Ken‚Äôs existential crisis
- ‚ÄúBarbie saved the world by giving girls role models of smart women‚Äù dry humour
- Don‚Äôt really love how the girl acted when Barbie came along and she 

Did not like:
- How they portrayed Ken. Almost all the men really. They were 1 dimensional / bumbling about (which is a trope unto itself)
- The patriarchy stuff. I appreciate explicitly calling out how men don‚Äôt just get what they want and have to do hard work to succeed‚Ä¶.

336,"I generally like movies that make you think and don‚Äôt hit you over the head with the message. As a piece of art it wasn‚Äôt subtle or subversive or thought provoking in any manner. Nor was it particularly funny.

Equality. Feminism. Mental health for men (yes really!!). All great messages. All messages I hope I can do my part to support. 

However it ignores all the progress women have made. 50 years ago they couldn‚Äôt open a bank account but now women under 30 are more likely to own a home than men are. They also make up more slots in law school and med school than men. Can we celebrate the progress women have made instead of pretend it‚Äôs 1950?

Last was the stupid fucking scene at the bus stop when Margot Robbie told the old lady she was beautiful. The whole audience went awwww yes she is! Like no the fuck she‚Äôs not! And that is the whole point! You have value even if you don‚Äôt look like Margot Robbie. But no no no, use a feminist movie to continue to remind women that their value is tied to their beauty.

I definitely feel like a Barbie movie should discuss women‚Äôs issues and I don‚Äôt get the controversy behind that, but it really lacked nuance in the way it handled everything, especially when the mother gave a long speech about the point. I think going to the real world only to discover how shitty it was is a good idea, but the implication that women are second class citizens like the Kens are goes a bit far. Though I did like the implication that Kens could slowly gain more power over years through fighting, the same way that women had to, and if that was intentional I think it is a brilliant idea (though in that case the real world could‚Äôve mirrored it better by taking place earlier).

353,"I think for the intended audience it's a great movie and pretty entertaining; for a guy I felt like it was shoving it's message down my throat quite often. The fact that every male character (other than Allen) was either pathetic, stupid or severally unlikeable was as tired as it was expected for feminist media imo.

I found it incredibly hysterical that it took Ken maybe an afternoon to learn about the patriarchy and was immediately hooked on it. The Bill Clinton and Stallone montage was *chefs kiss, absolutely needed and made the movie for me comedy wise. 

I think the mom's speech about how hard women have it and cognitive dissonance about living as a woman kinda fell flat for me, ( I know I'm definitely not the target audience for it but still). Maybe it's cause I'm a younger guy who's seen women in plenty of leadership and management positions, but everyone has it hard not only women. We're all suffering in different ways and while it sucks having society have unrealistic expectations for what a woman is; it also sucks to have unrealistic expectations as to what a man is. I'm not saying that women's problems aren't real and they're definitely very large problems for half the population; it feels like women can talk about their problems and have sympathy but as a guy you're not only told you're the problem but that your problems don't exist and aren't worth dealing with. 

I agree quite a lot with the Mom's point though, it seems like there's no space or interest for just an ordinary person and you've got to be special or doing something or striving towards something to have any worth.

And then after having a monologue about how difficult being a woman is, they immediately start using their feminity to manipulate the men into fighting amongst themselves to maintain a society that benefits them. I understand that's probably the point that the director is trying to get across; there's pros and cons to how society views women but as a guy it's a weird flip. ""I hate how men treat women as sex objects, but let me use men's sexual appeal to benefit and then also mock them for it."" Idk maybe I misunderstood the theme there; but it felt especially cruel to weaponise the Ken's interests and desire to get the Barbie's to like them only to turn them against each other. If you don't like your husband's/boyfriends hobbies just tell him you're not into them; you don't need to manipulate them to do your bidding.

The Ken Civil War and then Kenough song was 5 Stars, Ryan Gosling really shines in this position. After the song was over and they realised that the Barbie's kept their power, I really wanted the Ken's to go, ""chill Barbie, I don't care about this shit anymore. I realise the love I actually wanted was brotherhood from the other Ken's and I chased you because I mistook my obsession for love"" and then form their Kendom in the mountains in peace.

I imagine that Barbie, as a brand, is intended to instill a sense of wonder, joy, and optimism - but the movie doesn‚Äôt even try to hide its seething disdain and cynicism.  It tried to pull heartstrings at the very end, but it was too little, too late.

The political messaging was muddled, though. If the Barbie world is the mirror of ours, what does it say that the Kens are so brick stupid? Is the problem with their takeover the inequity... or just their bad taste? What does it say that their place in society is promised to be respected... but explicitly curtailed? There was an excellent opportunity here to teach young men who think Feminism is a 4 letter word... but that didn't happen.

I wanted ""equality now"" and got ""be/love yourself.""

The Ken coup being played for such laughs really took the teeth out of what could have been a more scathing social rebuke. It felt like punches were pulled to not upset people who will definitely be upset regardless and whose opinions don't matter.

The movie was also not groundbreaking at all in the ‚Äúgender politics‚Äù department, it just told women that it‚Äôs okay to be average but you should work on yourself more, and told men that you can show emotions but society will make fun of you and treat you like a toddler, and you should also work on yourself.

417,"Unpopular opinion trigger alert & disclaimer that I have no fuss with the message of the movie.

I think the movie is just slightly above average, carried by the costume design, production design and Ryan Gosling as Ken. Everything else in the movie has writing and consistency issues that really didn‚Äôt let me enjoy it. 

The mother and daughter seem very tacked on with minimal character development and very few lines, the Mattel board is just absurdist for the sake of absurdism and seem like the only ‚Äútoy movie‚Äù element in the whole movie, and that stands out as the whole movie was not written as such. I hated every second of Will Ferrel on the screen.
Margot was amazing, but her character wasn‚Äôt given a ton to work with, I feel her development of becoming a human came from out of the blue, and she had a ton of inconsistencies with how she knew about fascism, but not about the patriarchy. Which is a political message not built into the consistency of the character and the world, and that‚Äôs dumb writing.

Also the movie was much less funny than I expected, my cinema only had a couple of laughs, most of them during Ken sequences. 
So I‚Äôd say the writing is not really up there, and the message gets weakened due to that. It‚Äôs on the nose and there are very few clever times where it shows how good it could have been. 

I watched Oppenheimer the day before, and that‚Äôs a movie that made me think much more and showcased the grim reality of conservatism and dividing better, without ever saying anything on the nose. I think I‚Äôm just sad Barbie could‚Äôt have done something similar, as I see the potential was there, I‚Äôll forget Barbie exists in two days, and I‚Äôll contemplate the grim reality of amoral political power and nuclear warfare for weeks.",2023-07-24 05:32:03,1,AskMen,Turbulent_Ad_2168,comment,"Men who have watched Barbie, what did you think about the movie?"
418,"I thought the movie was fantastic and fun and said a lot of things that needed to be said. I think it captured a lot of real feelings that both men and women experience. I think America Ferrera's monologue summed up perfectly why I'm sometimes glad I'm not a woman and having to deal with the impossible catch-22s of every aspect of their lives. But I think it also illustrated very well the trap that men fall into of thinking that if we're not being directly validated by a woman, the only other emotional survival tactic is to assert control over women. But it doesn't have to Barbie And Ken. It can be Barbie, *and* it can be Ken. I really liked how that was shown in the movie and I'll be chewing on that for a while.

I will also be surprised if it doesn't get adapted into a stage production. The music is great, especially the whole Ken sequence sequence near the end.",2023-07-24 05:29:32,1,AskMen,Scottholomew,comment,"Men who have watched Barbie, what did you think about the movie?"

But the Kens we‚Äôre having a blast and the societies seemed to be perfect. The reason why the 1960s gender roles for women sucked wasn‚Äôt because it was a utopia but because they were also abused.

441,"Fully- I thought it was a blast. Hilarious and self aware. Though that self awareness has a cost of being too heavy handed with its messages. It also had pacing issues with too much going on-causing it to feel a bit long. 

The messages feel somewhat in vain as well as less‚Ä¶.representative of more than one outlook. Both sexes have their issues in this world but it just seems it only wanted to talk about half of that. For what it was it gave pretty great resolutions for both in having both fund self worth and have the toxic versions of men learn to step away from that and seek value from themselves and meaning in their actions. The Barbie message was a bit harder bc it didn‚Äôt fully work in some capacity with the CEOs in real life still making huge money off of this. Overall great on the comedy side with maybe some refinement on some of the runtime and messages. 

I do feel, most likely bc I‚Äôm from a male perspective, that it really displayed males in a way that mainly was a subset of toxic people that I don‚Äôt feel I represent. I don‚Äôt want to be that and don‚Äôt associate with people like that. I know there are bits that aim to counteract that but it fell slightly short in comparison in my opinion.

What really bothered me was that it was about female empowerment and Barbie ends up apologizing to Ken even though Ken is the one that ruined Barbieland? That part kind of made me angry to be honest. Ken should be apologizing.

It felt like everybody put a lot of heart into their performances, and it showed. Margot Robbie is very careful about how her hands move, which I thought was a cool detail. Kate McKinnon had me in tears with her gymnastics. Michael Cera was a perfect sidekick.

There are a few jabs at men but I just saw the lighter side. There are some serious sections and I thought they were delivered well and didn't break with the flow of the movie too much.

I didn't find it depressing as some others have mentioned, neither the jokes or the ending. Ultimately the movie is called Barbie which is mainly a product for girls, and that's who they're appealing to. I don't think the jokes or themes are toxic, I think they're funny because there is a small spear of truth, maybe not as much where I am or in my experience (I like to think) but certainly in other places and in recent history.

Mattel also isn't just roasting men the whole time, it seemed quite honest about how Barbie has influenced girls positively and negatively and makes fun of some of their bad/problematic products.

The 2001 and Matrix homages were great. The humor was on point and I‚Äôd honestly recommend it.

509,"I thought it was a fascinating take. It flipped the power structure brilliantly. It gave men a view through the lens of a women in todays society, being a Ken in Barbieland and the struggles that comes with.

Likewise it gave women a view through the lens of a man, what it looks like when you dominate the power dynamics of society.

As a man watching it, there were a lot of interesting feelings of empathy towards women living in a patriarchal society that I‚Äôd never felt or could notice. The movie‚Äôs blunt and exaggerated take on all of this was eye opening.

Similarly, I thought it was brilliant how they explored and exposed what it looks like when you control a power structure, and the other side fights back a demands/gains power (Kens rising up and breaking through the matriarchy). It was interesting seeing myself and the group I was with cheer against the group in a lower position of power (Ken‚Äôs), with us wanting things to stay the same as they were before, where Barbie‚Äôs ruled Barbieland, as it always has been.

It definitely gave me a conflicted thoughts as I realized this and I‚Äôm still thinking about how I feel about it.

It‚Äôs not my type of film honestly but I didn‚Äôt regret seeing it. Not Greta Gerwig‚Äôs best film, I think it pales to Little Women and Ladybird but it‚Äôs a solid addition to her filmography.

513,"I didn't hate it, but thought the movie (as a movie) was terrible (felt like a parody of a marvel movie in many ways).  I thought it was successful at delivering it's message... for about the first 1/3 or 1/2.  From there, it provides a glitzy and vacuous affirmation of women's struggle.  There are some nice touches in that last half, but think there were serious inconsistencies w the movie's message, when thinking beyond ""just vote"" and ""be yourself"" (ignoring Glorias doll idea until it was determined to be profitable, keeping the board all male went under the radar, iirc are two big ones).  Wrote a review of the politics of it elsewhere (with some comments on the movie itself), can check my profile if you're interested.

TLDR, as one suit says in the movie: ""there's still patriarchy, we just hide it better""

Edit: there's also criticism that Barbieland went back to how it was before.  Idk if this is supposed to be misandryst, but it certainly parallels the fact that nothing in the real world (of the movie) changes, except there are ordinary Barbie dolls now, and Barbie is a real human.  So I'll give the benefit of the doubt and say they were trying to be smart, but idk

Edit: Would say a very similar film, in vacuity, aesthetic flair, and gendered identity politics is ""300"".  But ""Barbie"" does give a good critique of misogyny throughout IMO (relatively speaking), which theres nothing comparable to in ""300""",2023-07-23 19:44:11,1,AskMen,Sugbaable,comment,"Men who have watched Barbie, what did you think about the movie?"

I'd give it. 3/5 mostly due to story problems. The first half is great, but the second half is a mess.

The problem is - if you say - switched the genders in the story regardless of how it works you would call this movie blatantly sexist and misogynistic. Which would be totally fine is that was the point unfortunately the film plays it as the reverse being ""ok"". What I'm getting at is, I like mean spirited humour the problem is for me is it tries to have it both ways and have a moral high ground. It's not South Park (not that I was expecting that)

The mechanics of the world is s little janky but it's a fantasy world. However I'm reminded of Toy Story and those Frankenstein Toys in Sid's house and if you consider how the real world affects the fantasy, why we don't see Barbir with an Alien Head or something? (Other than Licensing)

545,"First time I saw it completely shitfaced and it was HILARIOUS!!!!!!!! I did think it was anti-men though and didn't appreciate that, although I still highly enjoyed myself.

Watched it again completely sober and it was notably less funny (still laughed), but I'm honestly a little confused by the messaging. It for sure has messages of feminism, but the fact that these are toys living in a literal Barbieland with the Barbies being just as ""qualified"" to be doctors, astronauts, and presidents as the Kens seems to me like it's also poking fun at the idea of a matriarchy as much as it does a patriarchy.

tl;dr It's amazing!!!!! I'd honestly watch it a few more times and also buy it on Blu-Ray! Already ordered the ""I am ‚ú®K‚ú®enough"" hoodie and too many toys.

555,"I watched it with my girlfriend.

I think the actors did great, I really liked the Ken parts mostly, they felt over the top and ridiculous in a funny way. Almost like Ken's shenanigans were reprehensible of course but humour comes out in the form of their ridiculousness. Also the Kens just have this Karate-Kid vibe which makes them cool.

Then of course it turns into a bigotry and hate fest for a couple of minutes on and off until the movie ends. It feels childish and it misses the mark at those points, felt like someone just couldn't bottle up their hatred anymore and spilled in the form of a script, but the rest of it still has charm, for example the feely parts are well done imo.

Our cinema had a barbie box outside and people absolutely loved taking pictures in it, I totally get it even though it's not my thing. Nearly every movie goer was wearing pink I thought that was cool.

I have a feeling some men will paint the film as ""anti-men"", but I did not feel that way at all.

My girlfriend and I laughed maybe too hard at the >!""You haven't seen The Godfather?!?""!< joke. 

But really, I think the film had a positive message for men too. For Ken's journey, it was about how dominant social norms (whether it was being Barbie's accessory in Barbieland, or patriarchy in the real world) can rob men from exploring their own identity and self-acceptance.

there was a joke about one of the kens talking to a barbie about why a certain porsche was such a good car and my girlfriend absolutely cackled and shook my arm at that. i probably had that exact conversation ‚Äúat‚Äù her earlier that day lol.

636,"It's a feminist movie, and refreshing for being so. It's difficult for me to get the nostalgia and it didn't communicate it's message particularly clearly, but was entertaining enough and it stirred the minds of everyone watching. I like that the solution at this stage is awareness, but in time and in some places it's structural and cultural so that by itself won't fix the inequality experienced by the vast majority of women by itself.

Feminism isn't about girl power, it is about having opportunities and access to the same rights and privileges. Men are also stereotyped, to their detriment, think about our prisoners, our suicides, the world's most dangerous jobs, the expectation to give your life for your country and work full time, take the promotion, sacrifice the family and be stoic about it. 

The solution begins with awareness and acceptance, but it ends when we stop imposing genders on people. That all said, there is a balance to be struck, we need order in our society and it is our responsibility to police them ourselves. It's okay to be masculine or feminine and to enjoy it, but not to force that on others.",2023-07-23 21:55:05,1,AskMen,BroccoliSubstantial2,comment,"Men who have watched Barbie, what did you think about the movie?"

It's clearly meant to be a movie by women for women, which is fine and gerwig has plenty of inside jokes and a thoughtful critique to keep an interesting and engaging.
But what representations of men and masculinity are present are both given too much and not enough development. I found it really interesting that almost the entire last half of the movie revolved around Ken and a simplified review of patriarchy, while also representing all of the male denizens of Barbieland as shallow masculine caricatures. The small group I watched it with ended up talking a hell of a lot more about the Ken's & their role than Barbie/the Barbies and their journey.

I imagine this movie is going to be a modern cult classic akin to Rocky Horror, Clueless, and Lady Bird.

691,"Even though this thread is full of men, who support the movie and its messages, the TwoXChromosomes subreddit still complained about the negative responses. The top post there right now is how men should stop telling women in that subreddit how Barbie opened their eyes and tell this to the other men in their lives. Another post I saw said that Kens in the movie are treated far better than marginalised people in the real world and because Kens are not competent, they did not deserve a chair at the table, so OP was baffled why would anybody complain about the end of the movie - Kens got it better than they deserved it, y'all. 

And this tells you all you need to know about why I hated this movie. Like the subreddit the movie looked down on men. It portrayed us as imbeciles, who either crave for women attention or for power the second we see it. It told women to not settle for anything less than full metamorphosis and made them the victims even when they were in power.

The movie tried to be this exploration of gender roles, patriarchy, consumerism and what means to be woman. But maybe because I am just a dumb hairy male ape all I got was that for nth time in any feminist media the villain in the end was the man, who got rescued from himself by the female protagonist. Maybe, I should have applauded the movie for at least having a scene where Barbie and Ken reconciled, right?

How gracious of feminists telling men that we are better off without women. Oh, was this not the message of the movie? I got so confused with so many messages - it is okay for somebody to be above you, it is not okay for you to rebel, it is okay for things to go back to how they were as long as the ""competent people"" are in charge. But I am sure that because ""all"" men in the real world treat women like how the movie treated men I should not be triggered. I should celebrate this movie, while I whip my wife to have her make me another sandwich. 

Or, maybe, Kens were just ideas of consumerism, which Barbie was trying to defeat, or Kens got it good at the end, or the movie was about only Barbie and her experience, or I did not get the messages, or it was all satire... Or maybe I just hate women? Pick a sentence I wrote and quote me to feel extra validated. 

It is such an amazing experience being man today - left and right they tell you not to complain, to always do more, to know that the problem is \*you\* and they portray you either like an imbecile, who needs a bit of power to turn into a villain, or full blown misogynist. If you ever have any problem with the narrative, it is always your fault, your inherent hatred towards women, your sexism and love for the patriarchy. Oh, and your pathetic loser for even not liking it. On the other end we have feminists, who constantly pat each other on the shoulders and at the end of the movie they would have this big monologue about how the world expects so much from them. 

The big insult of the movie is how, like in the real world, it twists everything related to men, while it justifies everything related to women.  If you, as a man, want some sort of validation for your actions you take or the thoughts you have, Barbie is not the movie for you. This is only reserved for women, who will meet our maker and ascend to the next evolution step.

692,"I did not like the ‚ÄúPatriarchy as Cult‚Äù angle, which seemed much too malicious on Ken‚Äôs part.  I would have preferred a more ‚ÄúBurned by the Promethean Fire‚Äù angle, where the concept of patriarchy (and horses) is naively gobbled up by all involved.

No consideration is given to the Kens that joined in the patriarchy- how they left the cult - other than a pathetic nod to their existential crisis at being treated as lesser beings in an actual apartheid.

I was also disturbed that the Barbies couldn‚Äôt consider winning a vote fair and square.  They were literally the upper-classed citizens of Barbieland, they had deprogrammed all the Barbies‚Ä¶and instead of simply voting and winning in a narrow but assured victory (I am assuming there are vastly more Barbie products than Ken products?!), they manipulated the men into warfare with the intention of making them miss the vote.   Given the state of American voting rights‚Ä¶not a very ethical method to secure victory in a republic.  Mind control the minorities and strip them of a voice???

But everything ends up farts and rainbows because Barbie is Pinocchio, ignore the fucked up messages from the previous Acts.

12,"While I enjoyed the film, and the message is nice, it kind of goes against human nature. 

Loneliness and lack of companionship is a major contributor to male suicide. This is one of the problems with feminism. It‚Äôs totally unsympathetic to the male experience, due to women having absolutely no idea how it feels to be a man or not caring at all because ""women have it worse"". Expressing this in feminists circles will get you brutally mocked (male tears) or men themselves will be blamed for how they are genuinely feeling. 

Just look how incel is now used as an insult for absolutely everyone who has issues with a lack of love in their lives, completely losing its original meaning. 

It‚Äôs all well and good saying ""you‚Äôre enough"", but it isn‚Äôt really true, is it? You can have the best friends in the world and the closest family possible, and it *isn‚Äôt* enough. The large majority of humans yearn for companionship. Hell. Ken was literally made to be Barbie‚Äôs partner and absolutely nobody ever purchased a Ken on his own lol. 

I believe there‚Äôs nothing greater in life than romantic love. It‚Äôs not a ""social construct"" and it‚Äôs not of the making of ""The Patriarchy"". It‚Äôs real and should be spoken about without fear of mockery, unchecked sexism and bullying.

Of course. You shouldn‚Äôt let the opposite sex absolutely define your existence. Especially when it‚Äôs purely to feed your shallow ego and sense of pride. There‚Äôs so much to life that makes it great.

Ken is forced to identify as his ""job."" 
Ken is forced to validate himself through the lens of Barbie.
And he thinks that there's a different system out there where he can push other people down and lift himself up so he'll finally have value.

But instead he just...allows himself to be more than the box he was being forced into.

He's a guy who likes horses.  He's not just his job.  He's not his girlfriend.  He doesn't have to compete with other Men (Kens), because lifting each other up feels better, and is better.

If you don't think you're good enough because of these societal benchmarks or gender stereotypes don't match up with who you are and where you are in your life, **that's okay.**

You are enough.  This feeling is normal.

And there's strength and true freedom where you can be yourself and not the person other people expect you to be.

It's a message that's incredibly important for men, and often times when I'm talking other men off of ledges the message of Ken encapsulates the core of what I try to communicate to them.

It's okay you don't own a multi-family sized home in your 20's.

The ENTIRE Ken song is portraying this expertly, even in the opening few lines where he admits he doesn‚Äôt know what he is feeling.

He can't base his life around Barbie and essentially be a simp for her. But he also can't buy into what others tell him is manly. He can't base his identity off materialistic things like trucks and beers. He has to be a person. 

In the age we live in where men are constantly told to be manly and that female validation is all that matters in life, it was nice to see a movie that told men you need to be yourself. Even to this day I'm surrounded by men who tell me I'm not manly like them because I don't live their type of super macho lifestyle. When I was young not having a GF and seeing dudes like this really F'd with me. 

As an adult now I understand it's about what's inside that counts. Not what you have.

66,"Ken is the only one with a complete, satisfying story arc. 

He starts out a pathetic toy among toys, needing validation of Barbies since that‚Äôs all that he‚Äôs allowed.  

He courageously (sort of, lol) goes with Barbie to see the real world.

He learns that he doesn‚Äôt have to be a second class citizen. 

He takes over Barbieland but gets a little too high on feeling empowered for once in his existence.  Barbies weirdly just hand over their power to Kens, start living for male attention. 

After being dethroned, Ken realizes that the inequity didn‚Äôt feel right even when he was on top.  This is a peak human insight. 

He grows into an individual who is satisfied with himself, which makes him a better friend and man. 

Meanwhile the Barbies:

Start with all the power, happy to let Ken‚Äôs be second class and disposable. 

Hand over that power as soon as a Ken stands up for himself.

Get the power back and go immediately back to an unequal society.  No growth or sense of empathy gained after being on the bottom.  The takeaway lesson seems to be matriarchy good, patriarchy bad.

Main Barbie was rewarded with genitals and having to live in a world entirely run by men.  

(Note: in our universe Mattel executives are 43% women but I get that it‚Äôs supposed to be a simplistic narrative) 

She has no skills, income, place to live.    All she has is her amazing looks, which doesn‚Äôt bode well for her future in a male run world.   If she‚Äôs lucky she‚Äôll find a man to take care of her.   If not, what, prostitution?

and tho it‚Äôs a reverse patriarchy and that‚Äôs not what feminists want because their focus is equity and equality not a reverse patriarchy it still is unique in honoring the value of femme characters and showing important topics as well as silliness and nostalgia

Obviously seeing a story of how a masculine type character is learning to be worthy on their own is important to men who are going to see themselves in the character but it represents women in the real world.

Being a real woman means having a partner (of any gender) to grow old together, maybe have children (not necessary, but common enough, no?) And same goes for being a man.

And while people who will bemoan feminism won't like the references to patriarchy in the real world, it's not as bad as the matriarchy in Barbieland. Hence why Ken can't believe a woman is a doctor.

97,"People who thought Ken was the villain of the story weren't paying attention. I think the reason people think that is because he takes a role that is traditionally feminine. He is the accessory for Barbie, not the other way around. In a world where women have often been used as decoration and adornment for the male lead in a movie, I think Gerwig's inversion of the trope makes it all the more visible and jarring. We see Ken rebelling against his role as Barbie's boyfriend, wanting to be more.

When Ken discovers that men in the real world have autonomy it's like a revelation. Instead of dealing with it in a healthy way though, he falls straight into knee-jerk reactionist male chauvinist territory. He reacts to having no agency by trying to take Barbie's. This leads him to be an antagonist, but he isn't a villain. In the end, he doesn't want to live alone in the Mojo Dojo Casa House, but he also knows that he is, indeed, Kenough. The Barbies also realize they have been oppressing the Kens, and vow to do better. But in a clever tongue-in-cheek nod to the struggles of modern feminism, they won't let Ken be *too* equal.

I really think by inverting the usual feminist tropes, the film really did paint Ken in a sympathetic light. Barbie and Ken were antagonists briefly, but their character arcs were a perfect parallel. Ken wanted to become his own person, out from Barbie's shadow. Barbie wanted to be a real person even though it was messy and imperfect. They both had to come to terms with the world around them and their roles in it.

As for validation, I think the whole movie was about finding value in oneself. Barbie's life was perfect, but boring and empty. She had to stop seeking perfection and realize that she is good enough as she is. Ken had to stop seeking validation from outside sources and realize he is his own person.

It was just my experience over the years that the validation that I, and most guys around me, seek was not really by women, but rather something more nebulous, either other men, fathers, or even ourselves.

Because what I saw growing up was a lot of playing the part to one of the boys, being hard and though because that's what you were told each time you asked for help and you want to be a good boy, or just feeling like shit because you feel broken and faulty and are just trying to find a way prove yourself wrong.

I think a lot of men rely on women in the their life to be their their only emotional support because of toxic masculinity or whatever and that makes them obsessed with finding a girlfriend\wife. But they have to play it cool and maybe they play it a little too cool and end up hurting or offending women. Which then starts a vicious cycle for them and with lackluster emotional support from their family or friends they just end up beating themselves up over it.

It's human to need validation from the opposite sex.

This is satire of a doll, with no meaningful message to actual men.  

Male purpose within society is innately tied to women as an aspect of family.  If a man wants a family, female validation is an intrinsic aspect of a man's social value in the pursuit of that family.

276,"Someone's probably already said it, but feminist messages don't have to necessarily be directed at women, nor communicated by women. Twitter and YouTube feminists aren't reflective of how the real world works any more than Twitter and YouTube engineers; plenty are sensible and well spoken, but there are some reactionaries and dinguses that exist as well. Feminism is about seeking equality for women, but that doesn't mean it's ideas can't or don't help men as a matter of course.

The message that Ken's feelings are valid, and that he can be good or bad or tough or weak to fit his own identity irrespective of Barbie *is a feminist message*. Men constantly seeking the validation of women, and staking their whole self-worth on it, is exhausting for both women and the men who engaging it. It helps everyone if more men start working on themselves and developing their self-worth; both in mutual dating and just life at large.

As far as the fictional story goes I sort of imagined that Ken was literally an extension of Barbie, and that he began feeling not-amazing for the same reason that she did. In plenty of cases women appreciate or even crave being fawned over and sought after, but when it never switches off it can go from embracing to binding; especially when those doing it become increasingly desperate to get an edge and behave erratically.

TLDR: Encouraging men to learn to be Kenough for themselves is a feminist message that helps both men *and* women in different ways.",2024-01-22 15:54:54,0,movies,CrabWoodsman,comment,The Barbie Movie's Unexpected Message for Men: Challenging the Need for Female Validation

280,"There's a reason why Ken wants Barbie's validation - watered down obviously because he's a toy and it's a children's movie - he wants to fuck Barbie.

His desire never went away. It took the entire film for Barbie to finally, in no uncertain terms - to reject his proposal. 

Obviously you need a movie to last more than 5 minutes - it can't just be ""Hey Barbie I love you"" ""Sorry Ken I don't feel that way about you"" but there is this strange mish mash between Ken's desire and his sense of self worth. It's almost like his desire is treated one and the same as his sense of self worth and the message could easily be confused with ""The desire is as wrong as his lack of self worth"".

Barbie isn't the reason for his living - it can't be, she isn't interested. But if she were interested, would it be a bad thing if she were? Is it always a bad thing for someone else to be your reason for living if they love you and you love them?

The problem is that the idea that men finding their own self-worth is treated as a bad thing in the film by all accounts, so it's a pretty good guess that this film will have most people take away all the wrong lessons from it. But the idea of men not needing to be validated by a woman in order to find self-worth is an interesting one.

363,"Yeah, I see it as more social commentary on class warfare, rather than feminism.  Kens are dim-witted, second class citizens.  Kens revolt and take over, having some sort of political power for the first time.  Barbies are not happy about being subjugated in the same way they subjugated the Kens.  So, they literally tamper with the election by lying and manipulating the Kens into not voting.  Then, after retaking the government, they prevent the Kens from ever regaining any political power by giving them a token ambassador and further manipulating them into feeling that being ruled by the Barbies is good kenough for them.

What's really funny to me, though, is that if you're looking at it through a gendered lens, rather than a political lens, there's a sympathetic commentary on incel culture in there.  I'm not sure if it was intentional or not, but the Ken-Barbie relationship shown in the movie is the epitome of the ""friendzone"".  Ken is literally made for no other reason than to love Barbie, yet Barbie is either completely oblivious of this fact or willfully ignorant.  Either way, Ken is perpetually led on and wants nothing more than to fulfill Barbie's desires in the hopes that she'll see how much he loves her.  That is, until he gets radicalized by the male-dominated ""real world"".  In the movie, Ken magically gets over it in 5 minutes after a short speech.  In the real-real world, that's not how it works, though, and can take a lot of self reflection, therapy, and a good support system, which is out of reach for a lot of men for various reasons.

Whatever the case, it's a brilliant movie.  10/10.  And it boggles my mind that the right dismiss it as liberal propaganda when it's so clearly pro-conservative.

People criticized Barbie for being a little too on the nose about its message. I know men who saw it and felt like the preaching was too heavy-handed. I think maybe they had a point, in the respect that any male who watched the movie and needed to receive the message probably hated it. Good messaging movies plant seeds.

384,"I have 2 major frustrations with movies today which have basically turned me from a total moviepile who would see absolutely every movie that came out most of which in the theater to someone who barely sees anything now. 

1)Too many movies are pushing a political agenda in a hamfisted way at the cost of the story/entertainment. It‚Äôs almost like producers have been convinced if a film has a political agenda we will completely ignore the fact that the story made no sense, the acting was phoned in, and the writing was horrific. Like all people want to do is the ability to watch something and share their head approvingly at the screen. Like I‚Äôm willing to go to a theater and pay an outrageous sum of money just to have my political/social ideologies reaffirmed. I love representation, diversity, and new stories from new perspectives when it makes narrative sense and it‚Äôs entertaining. At the end of the day I show up to escape, be entertained and if u can do one or both of those and make me think I‚Äôm ALL IN.

2)I CANT FU#%*!> stand how the push back to the issue I outline above had become so puddle deep and automatic. IF I HEAR GO WOKE GO BROKE ONE MORE TIME IM GONNA SMASH MY SCREENS. It‚Äôs such a thoughtless automatic over reaction it‚Äôs ruined the ability to point out legitimate criticism of pandering crap. Now every movie with a social theme that actually works or fits the narrative or a diverse or female cast is labeled as woke or whatever dumb bullshit term they use.

Barbie is a good of example of infusing a social message in a way that‚Äôs entertaining and fits the story. ITS FUCKING BARBIE it should have a feminist tone. I thought Barbie was entertaining, it simultaneously poked fun at over messaging social agendas while coming away with what I thought were valid and positive messages on gender and society.

I agree with the OP I actually thought there was a good message there for men as well as women. All in it was a good job at a tough premise and anyone who labeled it as woke either didn‚Äôt see it and should STFU or did see it and doesn‚Äôt have the intellectual capability to dissect the narrative in a Barbie move and thus they should STFU",2024-01-22 22:36:03,-1,movies,Tylerdurdin174,comment,The Barbie Movie's Unexpected Message for Men: Challenging the Need for Female Validation

And having it solely being a movie for woman, which would have been fine and I still probably would have liked it as I do all her work.

But the fact they actually went far enough into feminism and touched on the role men MUST play in feminism doing it so well without overshadowing its own message for woman is an amazing feat.

We are one of few species of animals with enough consciousness to be aware of our impact on the planet, we've reached a critical point in time where overpopulation is a thing, and also economically it's harder to have children coupled with no longer having the societal pressures to have children. My point is that we now have these deeply ingrained behaviors that are vestigial and so we are seeing a huge shift in how we think relationships should function.

402,"I agree OP, that is a much needed message that even some of the manophere that clams to be so pro men need to hear.  All they do is complain about women and yet the whole purpose is to become a ""high value"" man to attract women.  It's weird to make your who message against the very thing you are trying to attract.  

Overall I liked that movie, you have to be very fragile to be outraged by it.   It was actually written by the director and her husband.   I didn't find it overly extreme feminist in the sense that it was promoting a misandrist message.  There were some aspect that were that way such as the way the barbies treat the Kens in the beginning, particularly the way the main character does.  But that is the point, she ends up seeing it and apologies.  It didn't show that as a positive thing.      

Barbieland is a Matriarchy but the whole allowing one man on the supreme court is really to make a joke about how it had been for women.  It also makes sense when you understands that the land represents how young girls play with the dolls.  I think the point is that when girls are young they don't even think about Ken when they play, except as how it enhances Barbie, and unfortunately that is still how some Men think about women.  I didn't think it was over the top in it's messaging but it was not super easy on women either.   

I saw an interview with the husband, who didn't seem like a push over ""yes dear"" kind of husband.  He said he thought the movie was hard on men, and he thought that we could take it.   That's how I felt about it too.   Us men have had any number of movies written specifically for us, raunchy comedies, over the top action pics, toy based properties, and I hope we continue to do so in the future.  Why shouldn't Women have the same thing.   

The other thing I thought was awesome how much of the toys and outfits my wife recognized from her childhood, and how cool she thought that was.  Given that that has been a thing for us guys forever with toys and video games I could totally relate to that and it made me happy for her.  I think it's great that women get the same experience of reliving their childhood through a movie and a pretty good one at that.  

Like the guy said, it's hard on us, and yes there is plenty of nuance that is missing on some of the subjects it brings up, but over all we can take it.

419,"It was incredibly meaningful to me personally; as a youth and an adult cis man, much of my social behavior has been subconsciously shaped by the need for validation of my appearance, talents, opinions, and sexuality by women.

I think it is a cultural norm programmed into young men by lots of outside sources we are told that men are defined by our sexual prowess. The best thing a man can do is be with an attractive woman. This programmed thinking leads to misogyny and objectification of all women as shown in the film and daily life. But it also leads to a population of confused men who think what will make them happy is chasing esteem in the eyes of potential romantic partners.

It is messed up both for those who are romantically successful and those who are not. Men who don't ever have a relationship or consistent sex are pitied or mocked, which obviously gets in their heads and is really bad for self esteem. Those who do find themselves in a relationship, casual or serious, might wonder why they do not feel 100% fulfilled. Relationships and romance are really great, but when you're programmed to think that all that matters is having a woman love you, it makes you miss the forest for the trees.

Ken‚Äôs attempts to break out of the trap he‚Äôs in are incredibly toxic at first, because they‚Äôre all still oriented around his relation to Barbie.

1,"Fyi, I didn't hate it BUT I find the whole ""omg revelation"" energy around it kinda weird and most of my friends (guys and girls) have the same opinion. None of us are really into absurdist-style films so maybe there's also a stylistic factor. But ok, some dot points:  

* It didn't really say anything mind-blowing (e.g. the mum's monologue montage about how hard it can be to be a women is true but also I don't understand why some people treat it like a it changed their entire world view or was extremely deep etc.) 
* I felt like the metaphors got a bit muddled once the real world became a bit of a caricature. Don't get me wrong, I loved the funny scenes w the Barbie executives but it felt weird that they were acting so cartoonish in the ""real"" world when the ""real"" world is meant to be ""real""? Not sure if that made sense but again, I'm not a fan of absurdist style stuff so it's probably just personal preference. 
* Also on metaphors, I get that the Kens are meant to reflect the ""women"" of the real world and I'm cool w Barbieland not immediately giving them equal rights etc. but I felt like the other Barbies did not reflect on anything at all? Like stereotypical Barbie had an ""oh"" moment when she realised she didn't even know when the Ken's slept at night but the other Barbies had zero self-reflection about that. 
*  The teen girl's roast of Barbie. I get that it's meant to be exaggerated for humour. But the humour fell flat for me and drifted into cringey-territory. YMMV though. 
* Also this isn't a point against the move, but I'm not an avid-movie watcher so I probably missed a lot of the references to other movies that the director purposefully put in. 

To throw in some stuff I did enjoy about it: 

* Ken's character arc was a good one imo, makes sense he would want a sense of power after literally being defined as Barbie's boyfriend but her not liking him
* Any scene with Billie Eilish's song about like the appreciation of life and it's uncertainties etc. really hit home for me 
* Loved most of the jokes, especially the ending with the gyno joke 

**Overall**: It was a fine movie that didn't say anything new. I find it very weird that some people are so hard-core haters/lovers of it. I don't mind hard-core fans of it because why yuck someone's yum, but hardcore haters who treat the movie like it's the ""end of civilisation"" or something are like ??? to me. It's not a ""red-flag"" to have not enjoyed it but anyone who makes it their entire identity to hate it is a bit weird.

Edit: also just got reminded of this one SNL skit song ‚ÄúWelcome to Hell‚Äù. Felt like that song said a lot of what the Barbie movie said.",2023-10-16 17:40:00,1981,TwoXChromosomes,Cute_Event_4216,comment,"Women who disliked the Barbie movie, why?"

But that‚Äôs not why he becomes a misogynist, he does so because he lives in a society where he feels disrespected and he wants a patriarchy because he doesn‚Äôt want to be a second class citizen anymore, which really muddled the themes of the movie, especially at the end where he just goes right back to being a second class citizen",2023-10-16 18:18:14,136,TwoXChromosomes,eicaker,comment,"Women who disliked the Barbie movie, why?"

Plus the fact that Barbieland was implied to be equally as bad as the Kenland when in Barbieland, the kens were free but when the Kens took over, all the Barbies became subservient and mindless. Additionally, at the end Barbie apologises to Ken and he doesn't apologise back.

The movie portrayed a number of the boogey-man arguments that conservative men make in opposition to feminism as positive and progressive ideas.

The women used their wiles to manipulate the men in order to get them to go to war. ""Women don't get drafted!"" ""Women don't have it hard at all, think of all the men who've died in war!""

While the men were off fighting this war, the women staged a literal coup. They convened a session of congress to re-write the constitution without men present, and they changed it to favor themselves again. Conservative men have argued that this is one of feminism's aims.

There are more examples, but those are the ones that stuck out the most to me.

They marketed this shit as a feminist movie, and Gerwig has made feminism the theme of her film career thus far. This film indicates to me that Gerwig has no idea what feminism is, and that she will bow (has bowed) without reservation or resistance, to whatever the people with money tell her to do. That's the furthest thing from feminism.

Whereas in real life, patriarchy is a conceptualization of society where men are empowered and women, and deviations from ""men"", are explicitly excluded. There is no real sympathetic reason for it to exist other than to empower men. Matriarchy isn't exclusive; it is a governed society where power is held by women in equal or greater measures to men. It isn't the exclusion of men to the benefit of women. 

But the Barbie movie, at the onset, seems to think matriarchy, and feminism as a whole, is the empowerment of women to the degradation of men and there is never a promising or meaningful refutation of this premise throughout the movie.

30,"I disliked it because there was too much Ken. And I left feeling like Ken was evil and then pathetic and Barbie was just sad. There was no resolution.

The original plot was about Barbie's human feeling sad in the real world and and barbie's existensial crisis. And somehow it ended with Barbie letting Ken's have equalish autonomy in Barbieland and Barbie being depressed? 

The mother daughter plot fell flat to me. We hardly saw them bond. The ""teenagers don't like Barbie and it's regressive"" message never really went anywhere. And Mattell being run by all men who were out of touch was also never resolved. Somehow the Barbie movie became the Ken movie. It was about Ken going to the real world, finding patriarchy, becoming an A-hole and bringing patriarchy to Barbie land and then getting played by the Barbies and then sadly apologizing and saying patriarchy isn't what he wanted, he just wanted horses and for Barbie to be nice to him. Maybe if the other plots went anywhere, the Ken story wouldn't have overpowered the movie.

I loved the set, the music and the marketing. They hyped the movie like the story was going to be so unexpected, but it's 2023. I think it we all went in expecting a ""girl power"" movie. Also, why make a Barbie movie PG-13? Like ughh.

32,"I enjoyed it, but I didn't think it was an amazing, wonderful, perfect film. No. I also don't think it's worthy of a slew of awards. Some things were pretty solid: e.g., production design, costumes, the visuals. But I'm not crossing fingers for it to win a Best Picture nod. 

It was, imho, meant to be an experience film. Metamodernistic in that it was aware of its own faults and leaned into those faults while also critiquing those faults: e.g., capitalism BAD! But buy Barbie! But (wink wink), we all love Barbie, so consume? Or not? Which tracks.

If people were expecting ground-breaking cinema, then they're not going to get it. It was a cultural moment, not great filmmaking, imho. So, I 100% get why people were not into it.

33,"I enjoyed it for the most part but thought some parts were kinda muddled. I felt like the executives were sort of useless and nothing much happened with those characters - I wish there had been some sort of real reckoning with how marketing affects women and things like that. I felt like the resolution of the Ken issue was funny (the guitar scene was hilarious) but not particularly meaningful. I was a bit confused about what the message really was about how the two sexes are supposed to treat each other based on the Barbie's actions. I always thought using seduction to control men was a weak kind of move but that was the ultimate solution and that felt weird to me. On the other hand, I definitely didn't get why people were getting so up in arms about it though since I thought it was a relatively tame take on feminism and most other issues.

34,"I liked most of it and I thought the scenery was great and the jokes were funny. 


BUT the ending of the Ken arc really didn't sit right with me. As a former neglected kid I really identified with Ken, the way he slowly realised how many normal things he did not know because he never had them. Him being amazed at being asked the time was so incredibly heartbreaking.

 As if he was thinking ""wow someone views me as a real person who might know something instead of being viewed as a burden all the time. This is the happiest day of my life, I didn't know I could be treated this way.""

I really like his conflict resolution with stereotypical barbie, as she sincerely apologises and sees the hurt she has caused him while also maintaining her boundaries of not wanting a romantic relationship. 

And then...
The Kens ask to be represented in the Supreme Court, they don't even ask for equal representation, just one Ken to advocate for their rights. And president Barbie refuses. Noone disagrees. The one person in Barbieland who Ken felt finally acknowledged and seen by leaves to explore her new humanity and Ken is left behind back on square one. Homeless, without representation or rights. 

President Barbie didn't change the system, even after the barbies got a ""taste of their own medicine"". Which tells me she knows exactly what she is doing. And all the Barbies with her. They are continuing  to systemically oppress a minority, and they are not just ignorant.  They know what it feels like, they know exactly what they are doing. 

What a bleak ending. And knowing that the Kens are a representation of women in the real world doesn't make it much better.



For the record: I don't blame stereotypical Barbie for leaving Barbieland, she has no obligation to stay. It just feels really dark to leave Ken in more or less the same tragic existence he started in. Unseen, unheard. Sure, he has his own hobbies now, that's a little better I guess. But systemically, nothing has changed.",2023-10-16 19:28:44,24,TwoXChromosomes,Effective_Parking581,comment,"Women who disliked the Barbie movie, why?"
35,"I hate it. The more I thought about the movie it was downright sexist. Ken gets the far more dynamic arc, he is the one who makes choices, has an arc and is almost the main character by the end of the movie. Barbie is totally forgotten, to the extent the script itself jokes about it (‚Äúwhat about Barbie?‚Äù). Barbie is only ever reactive, almost passive as a character, while the Ken‚Äôs are the one who makes actual choices and struggle. Gloria and Sasha are totally nothing characters, they‚Äôre so generic. Sasha is the stereotypically derided ‚Äúactivist‚Äù character who magically realized the wonder of Barbie‚Äôs at the end for no identifiable reason beyond the demands of the script. 

And the idea that the shallowness of the movies politics id acceptable because its ""supposed to be feminist 101"" is basically just an excuse, especially considering how in interviews for this movie gerwig spoke of her high ambitions for the film; read her words she clearly didnt intend to make remedial entry level ""feminism"" (if one can even call it that) for kids. And grading the movie on this ""it's supposed to be simple"" standard is sexist itself. Not to mention the profits of this movie go towards supporting a company which runs sweatshops mostly staffed by poorly paid women who have faced sexual harassment in these factories.

It's kinda like ""all lives matter"" ""feminism."" I think this review is really good.

Also, it didn't make sense that all the Barbies were woken up by things they didn't experience themselves (like it was a world ruled by women and there's no way they had to handle their kens as much as the mom did) so I didn't get if in the end that world was paralell to the real one or just the mom's mind. And if it was the second, then why was Barbie able to get out and go the the gyn when she said she didn't have a vagina?

39,"The only child in the movie, America Ferrera's on screen daughter, is precocious, shrill, and a bad representation of kids in general.

Having Will Ferrell play the Mattel CEO was too on the nose, reminiscent of the Lego movie. The real Mattel board has many women on it, but in the movie they cast it as all male to exaggerate the political message. 

The movie gives mixed messages about patriarchy when it has Barbie re-conquer Barbie Land, and re-marginalize Ken at the end of the story. 

Lots of praise for Ryan Gosling's performance, but it was rather cartoonish in contrast to how Margot Robbie played Barbie. 

It's easy to take pot shots at a movie, but in the end it comes down to one question, ""would I want to see it a second time?"", and the answer is no, I did not leave the theater wanting more. I was getting tired of the story and the premise by the time the movie ended.

i saw a review on letterboxd by user wajda_long_face that really encapsulated my issue with the dichotomy between kens and barbies in the movie: ‚ÄúMatriarchal Barbieland exists in frictionless stasis; no conflict, no progress, no search for truth or meaning. Patriarchal reality is full of conflict, but it also has enormous potential for progress, truth, and the creation of meaning. When Ken introduces patriarchy to Barbieland, the dolls finally realize that they can transgress their assigned roles; they can deepen their bonds through struggle and resolution; they can learn to make and appreciate art - bad art, but still; and they can rewrite the entire meaning of their world, from Barbieland into Kendom. Mattel creates Barbieland, but Ken creates Kendom. Matriarchy is static, placid, dependent, and meaningless. Patriarchy is dynamic, creative, exciting, and meaningful.

The movie tried and failed to balance fun (dance choreos, silly jokes, etc) with serious (feminism). It felt like it suddenly cut from goofy to intense/deep. 

The plot pacing was weird. The first part in Barbieland felt very drawn out compared to the rest of the movie. 

Biggest L, imo: I would‚Äôve hoped that the feminist message was more progressive, especially since it took up a lot of screentime and rapidly cut away from many of the fun elements that made the movie great. If I were in the writer‚Äôs room, I would‚Äôve either gone full throttle with the feminist thing or not gone as on-the-nose with the monologues and whatnot. The message of Barbieland collapsing under the rule of men and the sharp contrast in treatment of women between the real world and Barbieland was extremely feminist and enough to get the point across, IMO. The explicit dialogue and monologues would‚Äôve been more appropriate if they wanted to introduce more nuanced feminist concepts. Instead, the feminist dialogue felt like feminism 101, which is great for people not exposed to feminism‚Ä¶ but for me, it fell flat because it lacked any kind of useful nuance, like intersectional feminism or the type of struggles women face even with high-powered positions in society.

Mid 1980s.  I remember receiving the message over and over-you can be whatever you want when you grow up.  Since as far back as I can remember, I wanted to be fighter pilot in the USAF.   I read as much on the subject as an elementary school kid could and I dreamed about bringing freedom to others with supersonic swiftness.  When I was 9 or 10 years old my school had a career day and someone from the military was xoming.   Up to that point, parades, my father's Marine gear and grandfather's Army gear, were my only real life visuals (?) of a soldier.  You can imagine how freakin' excited I was to learn he was a pilot in the Air Force!  Sitting at my desk, in front of this big, tough man who does what I want to do, wearing a uniform that I instantly pictured myself wearing as I climbed into my plane (which was always parked in my parents yard, I must not have known about military bases yet).   Question time came and I raised my hand over and over, but a boy always got picked.  I even got my favorite pen taken away for waving it in the air thinking maybe he just couldn't see my hand.  Finally, it was my turn!  For the life of me I don't know what my question was, all I remember was his unkind, unsmiling answer:
""We don't let girls pilot fighter planes, just boys.""

It crushed me, I didn't even have a response!  Then it got worse.  I was already the weird, nerdy girl living on the fringes of 4th or 5th grade society.  His rejection in front of the entire class, and their laughter, was a humiliation I will never forget.   For the rest of the school year, boys reminded me girls just aren't as good as them and girls wondered why I wanted to be a boy.   
Later, I realized I should have just told him I wanted to grow up to be a pilot's wife.  Even later, I realized that bringing freedom to the rest of the world isn't exactly what we do.  Somewhere in the middle, I learned pilots don't park their planes next to their swing sets.",2023-10-17 00:10:19,6,TwoXChromosomes,sillywabbitslayer,comment,"Women who disliked the Barbie movie, why?"

* I don't really understand how Gloria's monologue was supposed to snap the Barbies out of  being complacent with partriarchy Barbieland. It was well written, but literally just complaining about being a women? I wish they had found a different place for that speech and found a better solution for the patriarchy. Kinda made it like it was up to women to solve these power imbalances, when it's really men who need to be doing this work. 
* One of the tenants of feminism is that the patriarchy is bad for everyone, and I wish they had illustrated that more with Allen especially. He was obviously unhappy there but they kind of skirted around why. Kinda wish he had gone to the 'real world' as well and then broke the spell the Ken's had on Barbieland. 
* I do think it was pretty funny the way they ended with the Barbies giving Kens smaller roles in the government as tokens, as (I thought) it was making fun of solutions that are currently in existence. I think a lot of people interpreted that very differently though.

For me, it was that the whole thing (from the marketing to the movie to the hype) felt like a long-form advertisement for Barbie and Mattel.

83,"Personally, as someone who was very excited to watch Barbie and got dressed up and everything, the movie felt like a collection of Easter eggs rather than a well-planned and well-executed tale about anything. 

The hand painted set, the little details about camera panning and Barbie floating down from her dreamhouse, etc. are cool, but I don‚Äôt watch a movie just because it has a hand painted set. And I already knew of them from the teasers.

The film didn‚Äôt really say much about anything; the points about Mattel and capitalism kind of withered upon themselves when the boss was like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care that mojo dojo casa houses are selling out! I care about little girls‚Äô dreams!‚Äù, and the points about feminism were either half-baked or extremely in-your-face.

And I know that the Barbieland ending with Kens being limited to lower court judges was supposed to just be a dig at the real world, but as a woman, I don‚Äôt want to be reminded of how we‚Äôre not treated equally if you‚Äôre not going to tell me how to fix it or give me some story or witticism or further intellectual insight. It was just another Easter egg about world. And I don‚Äôt want to pay to watch that when I already have to live in the world. And could just read that in someone else‚Äôs entertaining review about the movie. 

The one thing I did like was that the movie would have done a good job of getting people who aren‚Äôt very feminist to feel bad for the Kens being ignored by Barbies and then realize that the Kens didn‚Äôt actually represent men but women in the real world. But I don‚Äôt hate feminism, so the message didn‚Äôt really do much for me. 

Basically just felt like the movie was a big nothing burger in terms of having a real meaning. It was all about Easter eggs and little details and mirroring the world rather than saying anything interesting about it. The world is unfair towards women. Yes it is.

Like it was honestly a really enjoyable movie. I enjoyed it. However, it pulled it's punches way too much to feel like a 'win' for me or be memorable in any way. Everything it said and did it's just reiterating on. It's a GREAT movie for a younger audience who haven't already been exposed to that kind of messaging, but as a fully grown adult it was very ""been there, seen that"".

If someone asked to watch it with me, I wouldn't protest. I'd watch it again with them and have a fine experience. But if someone asked me if it was worth watching, I'd shrug and go, ""Egh, maybe? It's a bit of a romp, so great if you're in the mood for it or are really into Barbie right now, but honestly if you just want that sort of vibe I might go for the Clue movie instead.""

I was hoping theyd go back to that topic later how women are upheld to such unrealistic beauty standards & any normal signs of aging, such as cellulite, are seen are undesirable & that we're ""expiring."" we're pushed to buy anti aging products, to stay slim yet curvy, to work out but not get too big otherwise we'll look like a man, to pursue careers yet also be asked about our aspirations to start a family, etc. but it very little discusses these issues‚Ä¶

I also loved the scene where she called the elderly woman beautiful! But I was hoping it'd lead to a later discussion about how women's existence surrounding the misconception that their looks will deteriorate after their 20's & that we must spend a grandiose amount of time & money dedicated to preserving our ""youthful beauty."" But again, it didn‚Äôt address this at all when I thought that‚Äôs where it was leading to.

I also liked the scene where ken realizes that in the real world, it is man dominanted. every president has been a man, men hold most positions of power, etc. but I disliked how their resolution was matriarchy in barbieland. I understand it was supposed to be like ""when the patriarchy is dismantled in the real world then we'll change it"" but i didnt rlly love that message... neither men or women are better. we're just different. & that's okay.

Also don't love that the only good man in the movie was portrayed as an ostracized loser... I feel like it's a poor representation of healthy masculinity. why cant men be both compassionate & caring individuals, while also being traditionally masculine? I feel like
Allan's role sends off the message that it's not masculine to be a good person. it's also okay to not be conventionally masculine, it doesn't make you less of a man who deserves to be shunned... Idk i just didn't like that everyone was a jerk to Allan & he was the only good guy.

I honestly went in so hyped from the trailers and was pretty disappointed in the movie. It wasn‚Äôt bad per se but I expected a lot more.

(Like in a Big Bang theory way, I half expected a robotic laugh track in the background as characters paused after saying something). 
- The message actually felt dated. It feels like this would have been monumental in the 2010s range but seemed really watered down for a modern day movie. It felt ‚Äúsafe‚Äù and pandering, only discussing very surface level views of feminism
- Personal preference but I don‚Äôt like when media too explicitly states a message rather than artfully showing it. And oh my god, it was so in your face by the end of it.
- the teen‚Äôs speech was so cringey. I had to hide my face from secondhand embarrassment. The mothers speech was slightly better but still a bit over the top

And very American. 3) The tone was confusing. If you're going to make a ""fish out of the water"" type of movie, don't make the real world also theatre-like (The ""real world"" did not feel real so the contrast was poor). 4) Gloria was underutilised as a character. I thought she was the most interesting part tbh, as she felt real, and they almost didn't do anything with her. The reveal that it was her playing with Barbie was cool, as well as her relationships with her kid and husband! Do more with it. 5) Forced dialogues very often. 6) Story was all over the place.

I watched that entire movie multiple times. I preordered it, I preordered the Ken doll, I really love this movie. But not for the feminist reasons or even that part of the movie. I enjoyed Barbie getting to see Humanity from a fresh pair of eyes. 

But honestly.. the whole reason I love that movie is because I genuinely enjoy Himbos in media. I really, really, really love himbo men in movies and other media. The only reason I sat down to watch the movie in the first place is because Michael Cera was in it and I was ecstatic to see him in something again and not as a voice actor. I walked away a new fan of Ryan Gosling. 

I really enjoyed that watching the movie felt like playing with dolls all over again even in the real world. All of their actions were like if I was playing with my toys.

Why would she just go off on a total stranger like that? This isn't a world where people interact with toys on a regular basis but for one scene it is? No one has an issue with strange adults on this school campus engaging with the children and stealing shit? Why is everyone at Mattel dressed the same? Why don't they have openings for the cubicles? Why is Will Ferrell in this movie at all? So there's a living breathing Skipper shoved in a box at Mattel somewhere? They already knew how to enter and exit Barbieland but the plan was shove her in a box and hide her? If Ken thought patriarchy had to do with horses and got bored of it as soon as he realized it didn't, why does the second half of the movie even exist?

I know it's just question after question, but that's how the whole movie went. Every scene...Why would they do that? The movie left me feeling very stressed and down.

""Look at Margot as a Barbie"" and now ""let's cover every emotion and thought Ryan has"". And it made SO MUCH MONEY so I'm probably looking forward to more like this?

2. I hated how women thought they could only distract men by the promise of sex and asking questions pretending they are interested in their interests and competences. Also fhe way women asked those questions was so irritating. 
The funniest is, each one of those men turned out to be very knowledgeable about stuff. I haven‚Äôt seen a woman, besides the weirdo barbie, with many valuable skills. Even the president looked like the sat around looking pretty.

3. Also, to me it looked like Barbies used playing stupid to get out of many other situations. I do the same at work so I wanted to see this fantasy world where that wouldn‚Äôt happen and men would still be responsive and situations would resolve favorably for women. Silly me. 

Also, up until a 100 years ago we were practically owned by men. Every movie ever made succeeds in ignoring that as a central point.

134,"Woman here. I disliked it on several counts. Probably an unpopular opinion but here goes. 
The first half was okay; some humor and some barbs at the misogynism in society. Fine. 
But then in the second half it tries to make a weird switch from something that was trying to be all light hearted into something fraught with speeches about the issues with society and the meaning of being a woman. And then at one point there was one of the characters who worked at the corporatation (forgot the names sorry) it was the mum (who incidentally also made the speeches) and she did a bad ass move with her car and her daughter was all impressed and asks where did you learn it? And her mum replied an ex-boyfriend taught me. Like...who wrote that? Could they not have written so she actually had a hobby and learned when she was younger? What was the point of that dialogue? Or the other one...same character gives idea to office full of men on how to make money...gets nothing out of it....and does not even change job or try to do idea herself? Or Barbie's big thing at the end was that she went to a gynae? I mean come on. If it had been a film that was trying to be just humorous with some barbs thrown in it would have been fine to end it like that but adding all the speeches about what it means to be a woman etc and then just having the main characters not get anywhere felt like a let down if I'm honest. It felt very much as if the writers were unsure if they should go with funny or meaningful and tried to do both in half measures and it felt like it really detracted from the message that they were trying to get across and that even the message itself was very slapped on, no naunces, nothing. 
Add to that that both the main characters were just nasty to eachother and borderline abusive. Barbie not caring ken is homeless, ken not caring about what barbie was trying to do when she went to human world but going off on a man adventure. Both of them saying very questionable stuff.

Some progress in Barbieland was made, yet by the narrator's admission, Barbieland is behind the real world (""Ken's will one day hold the same power as women in the real world""). I was hoping in addition to the Barbies realizing that both their old system and patriarchy are problematic, they would learn that a society where everyone is truly equal is the ideal one.

I thought that upon the Barbies learning about both the patriarchy and feminism that they would have have rewritten their constitution to treat Kens equally, let Kens vote, held elections where both Kens and Barbies are candidates, etc. Why say ""oh, maybe Kens do deserve to be treated better"" and then go back to pretty much the same system?

I didn't feel any ""woman power"" either; it was overshadowed by the blatent misandry. And I'm as against misandry as I am against misogyny. They are clearly the same thing gender swapped.",2023-10-16 21:17:20,3,TwoXChromosomes,TheAllegedGenius,comment,"Women who disliked the Barbie movie, why?"

168,"If you take a step back, it's not about men at all.  I mean sure Ken has a weird existential crisis but I feel like he's more of a metaphor rather than a representation of men.  

Ultimately, it's about the different stages of being a woman:  From a child to an adult, then a mother where the cycle starts all over.  

Barbie lives in an imaginary world full of wonder where everything is simple, much like the way a child sees the world.  Suddenly she's faced with the real world.  It's harsh and ugly but also beautiful in its own way.  Growing up means a lot of harsh lessons but Barbie ultimately finds that beautiful.  

In some ways Barbie is transitioning from being like a child to becoming an adult woman.  That includes understanding how her actions affect others (Her treatment of Ken, who she apologizes to).  The world doesn't revolve around her and she has to face the consequences of her actions.  

I don't view Ken as a representation of men but as a representation of unhealthy attachments that lead to unhealthy behaviors.  Ken didn't know who he was without Barbie.  Even without Barbie, it was still all about Barbie.  He moved into her house, he took over her position in Barbie world.  At the end, he realized he needed to figure out who he was independent of her.

I thought to myself, finally a movie with a message and a movie that is NOT a superhero movie!  


I did not enjoy the movie whatsoever and mostly felt bad for dragging my fiance to such an unenjoyable film. I considered walking out many times but kept waiting for it to ""get better"".  


* The humor was not my style, I also blew air out of my nose twice. I should mention though that I rarely go to see comedies, funny movies are usually not my thing.
* The feminism that everyone touted as so ""progressive"" / ""eye opening"" was just not that at all to me. My fiance and I frequently discuss actual feminist topics and I feel neither of us  needed to see a shallow barbie satire about it to drive home the point that men are privileged. It felt like ""Yeah, we get it, what else?""
* As I didn't play with Barbie as a kid, I didn't experience any nostalgia that I think you were supposed to get from the movie (showing different style barbie / barbie clothes / barbie cars).
* I didn't enjoy the characters at all. Obviously they are not very deep and they're not supposed to be, they are satirical characters. But Barbie and Ken were just super uninteresting for me to watch and I wasn't even mildly interested in watching their progression or how the movie ends for them.
* I didn't enjoy the pacing. I swear I felt like I was waiting for the movie to start for 90 minutes.
* I actually missed the ending / the final speech there at the end, because I was so zoned out at that point from lack of interest.
* I don't enjoy musicals in general so the singing scenes are cringey to get through for me.

197,"32 female here, 

hated it too. 

Why?  *_First of all, disclaimer: I will massively spoil the movie if you haven‚Äôt seen it yet, don‚Äôt read this if you still want to see it_* 

Well, it‚Äôs much easier to say what I _liked_ about it , cause that‚Äôs a shorter list; I liked the main cast Margot and Ryan , they are one of the best actors atm. And the first 10 minutes of the movie is great. Just perfect, exactly what you expect of a Barbie movie: the Barbie esthetic (the details and fantasy that they produced was the only but real artistic value that was given to the movie, it took time and money for them to build that whole studio and make it come to life), that first 10 minutes had a real potential to make a unique and surreal movie. 

But then..

It flopped. The Barbie that wants to go to the real world, was poorly executed (which was honestly a bad version of the Disney movie Unchanted (2007) which was actually funny.)

But Barbie went somewhere else, it went to a place of ‚Äòtrying to make a story‚Äô out of what looked like a movie that took too much effort to make in the first 10 minutes that they just decided to make their own jobs easier by incorporating ‚Äòthe real world‚Äô and add a political agenda to it. 

The jokes that were funny; kenough. And that‚Äôs it.
That‚Äôs it.

It wasn‚Äôt even a written joke, just a beautifully incorporated one among the chaos of kens universe.

And the only _for real_ ‚Äòmoment of beauty‚Äô and maybe the only essential hidden meaning for a movie that went too far in trying too hard,  was when Margot (who‚Äôs stunning by the way) looks at the old lady and says ‚Äòyou look beautiful‚Äô and has her first cry. Not because of a Barbie crying, not because Barbie is plastic and crying would be making her real, but just because there are no granny Barbie‚Äôs, and she has never seen an aged lady, and the flawless Barbie found beauty in what she saw, a wrinkled aged woman with nothing fashionable on, just a person who lived.

Everything else was so forced and I truly regretted seeing this in the theater. Had a hard time sitting it through, but did it anyway cause I felt sorry for some guys who went to see this movie by themselves, without a girlfriend, with beer, and they sat behind me.

The movie feels like a forced meme, like a forced meaningful political all-included message , and than they tried to end it alt with a ‚ÄòDumbledore vs. Harry moment‚Äô in nothingness with the open end of some existential questions. Dragging the whole fucking plot just to make it look meaningful.

Was it needed? No. 
Was it a barbie movie? No. 
Had it any artistic or cinematic value? No. 
Beside the great acting of two great actors who were the whole reason this movie was not considered bad imo, the story _sucked massively_ and the visual progression got worse during the movie.

I will most likely never ever watch the movie ever again. It had very much an expiration date on it, and in 10 years no one will speak of it as much as they made it a very marketing-appealing meme-maker movie for a brief moment of summer history. No true value was added, other than wasting my time and money for that tasteless crap.

198,"Kens are portrayed as victims but still viewed as idiots at the end, its ‚Äòman-hating‚Äô, etc. However, I‚Äôd even say the movie is not quite about female empowerment either or trying to prove women are stronger or better than men. 

The irony of the entire movie is that Barbies treat the Kens the way men treat women in the real world - Barbie IS the patriarchy. Barbies hold all positions of power in Barbieland and are the only ones represented in roles such as doctors, pilots, etc. Ken is only good for beach and looking good, nothing else. The Kens are merely accessories to Barbie, they are the arm candy to these powerful and self-sufficient women. Ken is only happy when he is with Barbie, he is nothing without Barbie. Sound familiar? The joke is on Ben Shapiro and others who  call it ‚Äòman-hating‚Äô, because really that‚Äôs just how men have treated and viewed women forever. 

Barbie cannot be happy without Ken. 

The second act of the film comes when Ryan Gosling returns from the ‚ÄòReal World‚Äô with a very skewed idea of what the patriarchy and masculinity is. This is where the film begins to highlight mens issues via exploring toxic masculinity - how men constantly needing to prove their masculinity and dominance not only hurts them but society as a whole. We see how it leads to wars between the Kens and promotes sexism by reducing women to objects, similarly to how it does in the real world. 

At the end of the movie we see Barbie ultimately wanting to make a more egalitarian society and encourage the Kens to pursue their own hopes and dreams. But Barbieland still only gets as egalitarian as woman currently can in the real world - for example, when Ken says ‚Äòmaybe we can even get a seat in the Supreme Court!‚Äô and president barbie immediately shuts them down by saying ‚Äòabosolutely not, MAYBE a seat in the House of Representatives‚Äô. I actually enjoy this ending because instead of pretending all the problems are Barbieland are solved, it shows they still have more work to do, just as we do here in the Real World.",2023-10-16 23:15:01,2,TwoXChromosomes,waukeegirl,comment,"Women who disliked the Barbie movie, why?"

I didn't hate the movie, but I care so much less about the issues addressed in the film. From Barbie's perspective it's pretty superficial. Aging, cellulite, women being CEOs or plumbers.

The kind of feminism I appreciate most is more class based to be honest. That means abortion, minimum wage (overwhelmingly impacts women), reproductive health care. Meanwhile the whole movie ends on a joke of seeing a gynecologist. 

It's not a terrible movie but you have to hunt for ways to say it does any good for women. I did like that when barbie rejects ken it's because ""I don't want to"", vs any other explanation. 

I'm a woman, female 30, I'd say I'm a feminist but I'm not sure what kind. I can agree or disagree with individual feminisms depending on the issue.",2023-10-16 21:24:27,2,TwoXChromosomes,BlushButterfree,comment,"Women who disliked the Barbie movie, why?"

I did not like how the movie showed the Kens inconsequentially enjoying the power of patriarchy. I think for those who watch the movie who aren't familiar with these issues might think like 'if this is what it is like for men, why would we give it up.' While men suffer the least under patriarchy, they do suffer when considering mental health, inability to process emotion, responsibility, ect. 

The biggest example is the Ken musical number. Men cannot do that freely in a patriarchal society. 

Again men do suffer the least in patriarchy, and morally have a responsibility to use their power to change it, but I think not showing how men suffer in it is an important part of the issue that should have been shown.",2023-10-16 20:45:52,2,TwoXChromosomes,MammaCat22,comment,"Women who disliked the Barbie movie, why?"

I think all the people making a big deal out of it on both sides is kind of silly, but to each their own.

254,"The visuals were stunning, the community surrounding the movie was great (I'm going as Barbie for Halloween despite not liking the movie because I want in on all the 'hi Barbie's), but the messaging really made me upset for a number of reasons.

1. There was only one character that was really fleshed out and who had a true character arc: Ken. He was unhappy, tried forcing his way, and eventually realized that he needs to find meaning within. Barbie didn't get an arc like that. I know people will say that her character arc was her wanting to become a real woman and leave Barbie Land for the real world, but I'd hardly call what she had an arc. For the entire movie, all she wanted was to return to Barbie Land and for things to go back to normal. That didn't change until the last 5 minutes of the movie when it felt like the writers went ""oh yeah- we need to give our main character some sort of half-assed arc now, don't we?"" and boom- out of nowhere Barbie wants to become a real woman in the real world (or maybe not _nowhere_ , the scene with the older woman and with Ruth had heart, but wasn't enough to constitute any sort of arc or for Barbie's decision at the end not to feel like a total 180).  
As for Sasha and Gloria, they hardly had an arc. The movie never spent any time identifying what Sasha and Gloria's issues with each other even were, so them solving their issues with one another fell completely flat. Why did they have an issue to begin with? Why, exactly, did they solve it? It felt like they had issues with each other and, just like with Barbie, boom: everything is immediately solved and wrapped up with no explanation. I didn't feel like Gloria's personal arc with Normal Barbie was very fleshed out either.  
For a movie that was supposed to be by, for, and about women, giving the only real character arc to the man was a huge slap in the face. Every woman's ""arc"" was an afterthought.
2. I know that everybody has already touched on this, but the feminism speech was incredibly shallow, surface level, and repetitive. I've heard people say that that's the point: we're stuck repeating this again and again because nobody has been listening. But, I don't buy that explanation. I don't think the surface-level ""nothing new"" speech was any sort of feminist commentary. I think it was just surface level and nothing new. To have \_that\_ as the big climax of the movie and the thing that saves Barbie Land was kind of a joke. Plus, if the writers were trying to comment on how we need to keep having the same basic conversations over and over again because nobody is listening, then having that conversation yet again goes to show that the movie is made for those who haven't been listening to women rather than the women it claims to be made for.
3. I think the representation in the movie was really lacking, especially for a movie that touted itself as super inclusive. They had a plus sized Barbie, but covered her, and \_only her\_ upper arms and thighs for the entire movie. What kind of message does that send to plus-sized women and girls? ""We're super progressive for allowing someone who looks like you to be seen at all. Be sure to cover up as much as you can though, because its just your presence that's progressive and acceptable and your body is still taboo."" It's such an icky message to reinforce, and one that they could have easily broken.  
And, for a production with so many WOC on the cast, there was zero discussion of intersectionality. I really don't think \_something\_ on the topic was too much to ask of the movie, especially considering Barbie's history with pushing white women as the beauty standard.
4. I think that the movie pushed some really anti-feminist ideas. For example, President Barbie says during the Ken takeover that she's tired of constantly having to work and be a leader and that she's enjoying finally being able to relax. That could have been a great plot point and lead into discussion about how women have to do a disproportionate amount of labor. But, no.  The answer was instead to have her get back to work via a 2012 tumblr feminist speech. Physicist Barbie also says something similar and is met with the same response. I have to side eye this even more with the Barbies who said this being WOC, WOC being disproportionately tasked with extra labor, and the movie not addressing any intersectionality.  
In another instance, physicist barbie asks what she's wearing (a dress) when she's de-programmed, saying that she'd never wear something like that. Gloria responds with ""that's right, because you're a physicist,"" and puts her in pants instead. It was for laughs, I think, but what??? It's such an icky idea that you can't have a ""smart"" job and also be feminine/pretty. There are so many girls today who actually think this, and I don't think the joke was played off well.
5. A lot of other details about the movie just made no sense. Why was Barbie connected to Gloria specifically? What was with the Mattel CEOs? Why did they not care about money when the Ken toys were profitable, but cared suddenly when Gloria's normal Barbie was expected to be profitable? The whole Mattel side-plot felt unnecessary (Although I think it would have been hilarious for Mattel to be hellbent on getting Barbie back only to immediately just stop chasing her when the Ken toys became more profitable, and that's it; you never see them again).

I think that the response to the Barbie movie (and the Eras and Renaissance tours) did a lot in showing the world that women are a powerful group that more attention should be given to and fostered a sense of community that was amazing to be a part of. But, I don't think that the movie itself was very successful in its messaging.",2023-10-17 04:32:31,2,TwoXChromosomes,lanatlas,comment,"Women who disliked the Barbie movie, why?"

But for me there's another aspect, I was so thrilled to see the fun design that went into the ""Barbie world"", that when it turned out to be a reverse isekai plot into the boring regular world, it was pretty disappointing. It's like, we don't really see these sort of campy fun sets often anymore, that it feels like a waste that we don't get the whole movie set in Barbie world. If this movie had come out in the 2000s I feel like it WOULD have been just a fun romp with Barbies and Kens in this setting. But the fun is eclipsed by how much the movie wants to be *important*, and self-congratulatory for its very elementary feminism. Also because it's the 2020s everything wants to be ""meta"" so bad.

When I heard there'll be a Barbie movie, I was so excited because I watched so many Barbie movies as a kid and had a couple of dolls. Then I watched the movie and there's so many references... but all to the doll line. As I said, I had some Barbies, but I never followed or knew about the history of the doll line. I didn't even mind the references, but I was disappointed that they never mentioned anything about the movies. I feel like that was a very big part of their history in the early 2000s, so they just skipped over a big part of their history and excluded a bunch of fans who knew Barbie through their movies, not the dolls. I understand they might not have had the time to reference everything Barbie related, but due to it, the Barbie connection to me was kind of lost. I liked it as a movie, but it doesn't win extra points from me for being a homage to Barbie.

Adding to that, as others have said, while it was a great movie to point out the inequality in the world, it was nothing groundbreaking I hadn't heard before. I think many people can get value out of it, but they are more the people who either haven't heard of feminism much before, or they have, but they couldn't talk to people around them. I think it's great that people might've finally felt validated in their struggles. Or guys who society often doesn't talk about this stuff with finally learned more about it.

So while I found those two aspects just okay, overall it was a very fun movie to watch. I liked it, but I wasn't blown away by it, which I don't think anyone has to be.

360,"I really wanted to like it. I was really enjoying it at first, but then they get to the real world and... it's almost as cartoonish as barbie land. I think it'd have been much more effective to show a realistic world, and it would have contrasted a lot with barbie land anyway. 

I didn't care for the mom and daughter characters. The daughter made me cringe too much. Actually, the dialogue in general made me cringe. It was too on the nose.

The analogy was weird to me. Barbie land represents a reverse-patriarchy, right? Then things happen and now it is a patriarchy, but at the end of the movie we go back to reverse-patriarchy land. Writing it this way makes it feel like the kens represent the feminists ""taking it too far"", which is probably not what they wanted but it's the most logical interpretation. 

I think they should have committed to Barbie being the oppressor in barbie land and oppressed in the real world. She deals with some realistic misogyny, maybe helps a woman overcome some real life struggles, and then goes back to Barbie land, where she has her power back and she has to decide what to do with it. I actually think the ending of giving the kens just a little bit of power was effective in showing the parallel to the real world.

In the end, the experience just wasn't enjoyable. I half-laughed like two times, I didn't think the message worked, I cringed, and then I was just bored waiting for it to end.",2023-10-17 01:14:28,1,TwoXChromosomes,QualityCookies,comment,"Women who disliked the Barbie movie, why?"
361,"I liked it but it really felt like ""baby's first feminism"" which is great for little girls who are watching. It's a good introduction to feminism for kids. I also feel that the Ken storyline was a stronger story, had a far more interesting and fun way of tackling Ken's issues and it hollowed the Barbie storyline slightly which felt slightly underdeveloped.

There was one storyline too many for me. I think the mother-daughter was a bit naff and was just dropped rather than dealt with. Also, I heard my own eyes roll at that speech because it felt shoehorned in and quite basic. People clapped, so maybe I'm being a bit of an arse about that. I didn't really get why that teenage girl just immediately had that rant when she met Barbie.

Why did only Ken get a song? And a very fun song. ""My name's Ken - and so am I - put that manly hand in mine."" *Outstanding.* Either they both get a song or Barbie should get a song too.

I think at one point Greta said she was making an anti-capitalist film, but it was paid for by a huge company that sue people for using their font. They wouldn't let her tarnish the Barbie brand. I had a two-hour phone call with a friend of mine about the film afterwards and that's the sign of a good film.

Having said that, I thought it was visually fantastic. You could also feel how much fun the cast had, the whole thing radiated joy. Good script and a perfect cast. PHENOMENAL marketing. There will be dissertations written on the Barbie marketing. It was insanely fun, intelligent and adaptive. They had such a strong grasp on Social Media that I haven't really seen from a company before. The fact that they were smart enough to hype up Barbenheimer was very impressive. 

The humour was fun. I loved the P&P joke.

I thought it was fun but largely content-free. The buildup was good but there was no real resolution or message.


The movie portraits the real world as a broken, patriarchal hellhole, but Barbie decides to go live there for no stated reason.


The moments of realization and transformation are largely Hollywood's ""say words to swelling music so that they sound kind of meaningful"" gimmick.¬†

None of the characters were developed. 

Barbie was so unnecessarily rude to Ken. 

America Ferrara looked like she was acting. 

Neither America Ferrara or the daughter were likeable. 

I agree with America‚Äôs speech on contradicting expectations, but men also face some this. 

The storyline was ridiculous and nonsensical. 

For being misogynistic men, Mattel finances Barbieland where women can do or be anything they want. It‚Äôs the human women who decide Barbie can‚Äôt. 

Barbie says the other Barbie‚Äôs can‚Äôt do or shouldn‚Äôt want to do things based on their occupation. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a doctor!‚Äù Just because Barbie can be a doctor doesn‚Äôt mean Barbie has to want to be one or must act a certain way if she is a doctor. How simplistic. That‚Äôs not men making women feel a certain way, that‚Äôs an example of women making themselves feel that way.

Barbie‚Ä¶somehow‚Ä¶becomes human. How? Nobody knows. 

The movie ended with a random and unnecessary vagina joke.  You aren‚Äôt oppressed because your child‚Äôs toy doesn‚Äôt have genitalia. 

None of the movie was about reproduction so if that joke was about abortion rights or sexuality, it missed the mark. 

Somehow ken feels like more of a victim than Barbie. 

Equal rights was not a focus. 

The movie isn‚Äôt made for little girls or even fans of Barbie. It‚Äôs not even made for all women or all feminists. It‚Äôs seems to be made specifically for a certain sector of extreme progressive women.

SPOILER:  My biggest gripe was that Ken was treated not great by Barbie even after her ""epiphany"", and honestly for me Ken/Ryan Gossling MADE the movie.  Him pursuing her was so cute.   Ryan is so adorable and perfect Ken, why not have Barbie and Ken get together in some innocent way at end?    I consider myself a ""feminist"" in many ways but I didn't get or agree totally with the message.  Barbie rejects cute Ken and ends up in Birkenstocks?  Huh?  You can't get with Ken and like Birkenstocks AND heels and be for women?  The message can be construed be cold to men, that makes you powerful.  Huh?  My idea of feminism would have been  you can dress any way you like and be with a man or not.

I also didn't like the death message either since kids movie also, Barbie thinks of death and that propels her into an existential feminist crisis?  I think since the movie is for kids also and upbeat vibe, it could have been done better and death left out.   I did like  a lot of things about movie tho.

387,"Ok I don't dislike the Barbie movie, but I don't understand why it gets lauded as this amazing feminist movie. As far as I can tell, it's only feminist in the absolute most shallow sense. I'll list my issues with the movie and please correct me if I'm wrong or I misunderstood something.

Regardless of whether or not it was the intention, the normal audience goers are likely to see the Kens as representing the role women have in the real world. (Barbie world, everything is backwards! The women are in charge!)

In Barbie world, though, the men are shown to actually be somewhat stupid. They're shown as being incapable and kinda vengeful. So since one half of the population is actually incapable and Barbie world is intended as a metaphor for the real world, the implication is that one gender in the real world is incapable. I would argue that because the Kens represent women, women are (unintentionally or not) by extension represented as being incapable. Regardless, any sex or gender being dismissed as incapable is the exact opposite of feminism.

Then the end. At the end, the Barbies return everything to the status quo and the Kens are shown to be ""allowed"" to have little baby supporting roles. Why not accept the Kens and work together with them to strive for equal representation? Why infantilise them like this? Because they are inherently incapable? I still argue that the Kens represent the role women have in the real world, but even if they didn't, it's absolutely not ok to discriminate by gender like they do even by the end of the movie. Again, literally the opposite of feminism.

So, we have absolutely nothing radical or even feminist happen in the main plot of the movie. Even the dialogue touches on just the most superficial and uncontroversial of issues. Maybe I misunderstood a big point of the movie, and they're doing some deep, complicated, tongue in cheek, subversive shit with 1000 layers to it, and we're not meant to be on the Barbie's side but I'm certain, the average movie goer is not going to see that. The average takes (and we have seen those in real time) are either:

Feminism bad because how dare they say Kens/men are stupid and Barbies/women are better

Or feminism good, look at the Barbies having more power than the Kens/men!! They defeated the Kens/men!!

""Defeating"" any gender is not feminism. And if your take away is version 2, then you missed that the Kens represent women's roles in the real world, and not men. (Edit: both takes miss this.)

Or maybe I misunderstood something fundamental about the movie. Please do correct me if I'm wrong. There were many parts of the movie I enjoyed, and I do wish I could call the movie feminist.",2023-10-18 06:05:51,1,TwoXChromosomes,quadrotiles,comment,"Women who disliked the Barbie movie, why?"

395,"i actually wrote an entire essay about this. in the essay, i give examples, go into deeper analysis, and raise more reasons as to why i did not like the movie, but here is the tldr: The film suffers from thematic inconsistencies and missed opportunities. Key issues include unexplained brainwashing of Barbies, abrupt changes in Kens' roles, and Barbie's confusing dual existence as both doll and human. These inconsistencies lead to viewer dissatisfaction. The narrative's lack of coherence is evident in the superficial portrayal of relationships, such as Ruth Handler and Barbie's underdeveloped mother-daughter dynamic. 

Feminist themes are handled superficially, with the narrative often feeling juvenile and contradictory. Despite a lengthy runtime, the film overextends with too many plots, resulting in weak character development and unresolved storylines. The attempt at feminist commentary is clich√©d, lacking depth in addressing women's experiences and societal issues. 

Characters like the Kens and Sasha are poorly developed, with abrupt changes in their roles and motivations. Key moments, like Barbie's transformation and the mother-daughter reconciliation, are mishandled, feeling ungrounded and hastily concluded. The narrative's reliance on happenstance over character-driven decisions diminishes its depth and impact. Barbie was also dangerously underdeveloped, and did not grow as a character at all. The film set up many conflicts, but they were addressed seamlessly with really no effort on the part of the main characters. There was never any pay out. 

The film struggles with thematic inconsistencies and plot gaps, leading to viewer confusion. 

Additionally, key character transformations and reconciliations feel forced and inadequately explained, diminishing the film‚Äôs impact and leaving central themes like motherhood underexplored. 

The passive acceptance of an unchanged world by the characters contrasts with the film's claimed feminist narrative, highlighting thematic inconsistency. The film's portrayal of corporate dynamics particularly regarding leadership roles, sidesteps deeper feminist undertones, contributing to the film's superficial approach, particularly regarding gloria and the Mattel CEO. Character relationships feel cursory and superficial.

The film's handling of feminist and anti-patriarchal themes is particularly problematic. It subtly shifts blame from Kens to Barbies, muddying its stance on patriarchy. Ken's portrayal fluctuates between antagonist and misunderstood character, further complicating the message. Barbie's transformation from a doll to human is a narrative shortcut, undermining potential for deeper exploration of themes like empowerment and self-acceptance.

In conclusion, the film's simplistic approach and lack of depth in storytelling result in a mismatch between its intended message and actual portrayal, leading to a mediocre film that fails to captivate or inspire meaningful discourse. The film's resolutions and portrayal of feminist themes lack depth, and the narrative is driven more by commentary and plot devices than authentic storytelling.",2023-12-10 23:01:42,1,TwoXChromosomes,UsedParamedic2809,comment,"Women who disliked the Barbie movie, why?"

398,"I really didn't like how Ken obsessed over Barbie even though she from the very beginning wasn't interested in him. He joined a trip he wasn't invited on. He didn't protect Barbie (which he claimed was his reason for going) when goons came to get her. He spread his issues to all the other Kens wrecking their entire society. He got a long ass dance sequence and just in general took up way too much screen time. 

The points America Ferrera's character were making when she was waking up the Barbies were so great. But they were rushed over much too fast. 

I don't think the ""just Ken"" point they were trying to make landed at all. Barbie has to take on the role of his ""emotional guide"" even though she's really been struggling herself. She is the one who has to encourage him and cuddle him even though his behaviour throughout the entire movie was garbage. But they expect us to like him and feel sorry for him because he's just so in love (obsessed) with Barbie!  And that means that he's somehow owed something, right?

And then at the end Barbie's ""big step"" as a real woman is going to the gyno. Meaning that having a vagina is what makes you a real woman? Or? 

I was so confused when I saw this movie that I had to watch it again. I really don't understand why people call it feminist or progressive. 

He basically stalks her even though she clearly isn't interested. Yet he gets a ""not every night has to be girls' night"" cave in on her part. A man's desire to be with you does not mean you have to give him any of your time if you don't really want to! What kind of lesson is that!

I think this movie is such a horrible example of Hollywood feminism! It is more about sending an empty Girl Boss/Girl Power kinda vibe but with no real power. If one Ken could overthrow the government in one day, then the Barbies were never in charge. And if women have to rely on the infighting of men to get anything done, then they don't have any real power or influence. 

This movie just made me feel sad. 

I almost would have preferred just a sparkly romantic comedy where Barbie and Ken get together. At least we know what that kinda shit is selling.

What I didn't really like was the ""I am Ken - nough"" (that got annoyingly popular too quickly) and the whole ""oppression of women hurts men too"", because 1) it's old, 2) it doesn't hurt men as much as people think - at least, not in the ways it hurts women, and 3) centering the incentives and reasons behind freeing/helping women around men is kinda basic and overused by now. There's already too many stories out there that centre a woman's empowerment around honouring or supporting a man. Very few that are brave enough to go full on in women's relationships with each other (which I appreciate Barbie tried to do).

408,"I only now watched the movie and realised something. The movie is shit. The comedy is bad. And the message it sends is also shit and nothing new.

But the more interesting phenomenom here is the hype around a movie that is nothing special, well actually less than nothing special. 
People tend to grab the hype when there is a ‚Äúpowerful message‚Äù behind it. And that is because they want to show everyone they understood this message, that they are woke about the problems in the society and that they are better than you me or them who did not get the message or do not think the message is something special. This is the most powerful tool of controlling the masses - give them something that makes them feel better about themselves. 

Even now after the golden globes, this same thing is showing‚Ä¶ if you jumped on the wagon and did a video of blaming this guy for the jokes he made, you were perceived as woke, as a good society member, as someone who understands problems and wants a change. 

The accusations are happening all over the internet when reading about Barbie. 
‚ÄúYou hated the movie because you are a man and do not understand the message!‚Äù
‚ÄúHow can you, a woman, hate this movie? You must be very priviledged to not feel gender inequality‚Äù
‚ÄúYou are everything that is wrong with society because you do not understand the message!‚Äù

And let me tell you what. All of you who felt this message so hard that it made you feel like sharing it, arguing with other people and making bad comments to other who dissagree are everything that is wrong with society nowadays.

They give us something to bicker about, to make us feel better about ourselves, to create a feeling that problems are being spoken of, that its gonna get better and that things are changing. 

When in fact the richest only get richer, consumerism strenghtens and capitalism lives on. 

The movie was made for the profits not for the message. The profits of movie industry, cinema, fashion industry, toy industry and many others. Just think about all the brands that jumped in on it. The message is just there to engance these profits.

They have been widely criticised for giving little girls unrealistic body image issues as well. Wouldn't it be hypocritical of Barbie/Mattel to profess feminism now as if they weren't the cause of this misogyny problem in the first place? 

Barbie/Mattel's disingenuous attempt to absolve themselves of culpability when they helped institutionalise misogyny is hypocritical and clearly only done to remain relevant and profit off the woke ""Future is Female"" movement.

True they've made strides in ""championing"" feminism to repair their image through this movie. Okay we can give them that at the very least they have made changes. But the damage they have done is immense and their intentions are profit-centered. THEY PROFITED OFF MISOGYNY BEFORE AND PROFITING OFF FEMINISM NOW. People should be aware of this and not just eat it all up. Yes, America Ferrera's monologue deeply resonates with me as a woman but Mattel did it for less than pure intentions.

410,"For me, the writing was poor. It was certainly a ‚Äúfeminism 101‚Äù type of movie, nothing challenging about the message‚Ä¶and the storyline was unclear. I don‚Äôt think the Will Ferrell storyline was clear at all and ever got concluded in any type of meaningful way. 

Some of the jokes landed for me but most of them didn‚Äôt. Visually cute movie but lacked substance. 

Plus any feminist movie that relies on ‚Äúboys are dumb‚Äù does a poor job of empowering women because it doesn‚Äôt give us enough credit for how hard the fight has actually been. The truth is that the patriarchy that women deal with in the real world is an expertly engineered system that was created to hold women down. It is intentional. Everywhere from politics to office buildings to universities there continue to be policies and status quos that exist just to disempower women.  The fact that we have risen up and fought back shows just how powerful women actually are.  The movie presented the feminist fight to be as easy as manipulating some stupid boys. It didn‚Äôt hit for me.

Then of course there‚Äôs the fact that the entire movie was paid for by Mattel.  As more people have realized the unrealistic body standards the Barbie dolls promote, and the outdated marketing sales have dropped. So the company paid to have a director who has historically made movies with strong female leads to make a 2 hour ad for Barbie dolls with watered down reasoning for why they are empowering to women.

The narrator *said* that Kens would ‚Äúhopefully‚Äù end up with the same rights/power as women in the real world (which are not exactly equal to men, but whatever) however we see President Barbie immediately deny their access to equal-level roles in their Justice. It seemed like they quietly argued that matriarchy is somehow better than patriarchy, at least enough to prefer one to the other. That was just odd to me.

The Barbies were pretty airhead-y and so were the Kens. The real world they portrayed was rather warped and exaggerated.

418,"This post is old enough now that I imagine no one is going to see this but.

&#x200B;

The vision of women's liberation that the Barbie movie presents is one where women don't want anything but to be ""good."" Doctor Barbie is a doctor because she is Doctor Barbie (because that's what the men at Mattel designated her as), and the tragedy of patriarchy is not that she cannot choose what she wants to do but that she is being kept from being the thing that she is supposed to be. This is a nightmarish vision of feminism, one that does not actually center women as we are but rather some particular idea of ""woman."" It is a feminism where the image of being fat is tolerated but the reality of having cellulite is a curse. The extent of feminism's work is to basically recite buzzfeed articles at each other about how bad we have it, and then step back into the high heels, the makeup, all the performance having suffered a slight brush with our own internal experience, happy to continue doing all the things that make that internal experience so fraught and scary. As long as we are good at our jobs, as long as we are being useful, inspiring, desirable, I guess it's fine.

Also:

1) There are no queer women. None. There are queer men, there are no queer women. Weird Barbie you could say is queer coded but she doesn't even express a passing desire for women.

2) There aren't even a lot of straight women. There is one. It is Weird Barbie. Who is played by a lesbian comedian. She is the only Barbie to express sexual desire at all, and it's for a Ken. The Kens in question are allowed to eyefuck eachother constantly and seem like real human beings because of it (I'm saying this as an ace person; the sexlessness of Barbies as a class is crushing.)

3) Frankly, Weird Barbie seems to be everyone's Barbie. The only women I know who did not play with their barbies ""too hard"" were not allowed to have barbies in the first place. Why maintain this fiction that she's some kind of rarefied thing? Because even this slight deviation from a womanhood as prescribed, that it's pointed out no one lives up to, has to be coded as a rare, special indulgence that only you, dear viewer, are privy to.

4) Barbie's apotheosis into real womanhood is... going to see a gynecologist. You can imagine how trans people would receive this.

If this movie wasn't trying to be a feminist work, and was trying to just be some character-driven thing about what it means to be a doll leaving a fantasy world (go see Life-Sized! It's so much better!) I don't think I would be so critical of it (or, I would as-is, but that's just because it's... not trying to do that so obviously it fails at it,) but specifically the fact that it is attempting to say something, the fact that the team cannot imagine anything outside of a life of pristine, heteropatriachal Stepfordia with the mercy of the authoritarian husband being absent and replaced by an internal sense of duty, makes me kind of afraid of and for well-off straight women.",2023-10-18 00:21:04,1,TwoXChromosomes,ManicPixieFuckUp,comment,"Women who disliked the Barbie movie, why?"

The real message of this film is that girls & women aren‚Äôt fulfilled by trying to be Barbie, even Barbie wasn‚Äôt fulfilled by being Barbie. We find fulfillment in the BOND with Barbie, and the bond with our baby. Barbie got turned into this message to girls of who to be. Humans crave a bond. Even Ken craved a bond with Barbie, and in the end Barbie gave up her Barbieland to go have a baby. Ruth made Barbie to celebrate her relationship with her daughter. I said this to my friend after the movie and I thought her head was going to spin around. Lol. That‚Äôs the real controversial message here, but it‚Äôs true.

Personally I felt Rhea Perlman‚Äôs monologue about motherhood came off as ‚Äúnot a true woman if you aren‚Äôt a mother‚Äù. I interpreted the last scene at the gyno appointment as Barbie taking steps towards motherhood, not gaining some sort of freedom or independence. 

I would not make a good mother and never have had that desire. So does that make me less of a woman? Does that make women who cannot have children less than?

Most of the really funny stuff was already in the trailers and I feel that the message was nothing new and so so so pre-chewed. There was nothing left for the audience to connect and discover by themselves. I think I felt that the movie didn't trust the viewer to understand if they didn't hit you over the head with it and spell it out in capital letters. 

After hearing how it was enlightening and a discovery for many people, I connect the dots and realized that it just wasn't directed towards me. I study at uni and have taken a fair few courses on gender in literature and have been interested in mother-daughter relationships. I have read up on that, feminisms, queer studies etc. Of course if we look on an academic level I haven't really done much reading, but if I compare with the general public I am really well informed. So while I could see everything coming a mile a way and it felt really basic and surface level that probably wasn't the movies fault. It was a blockbuster directed to the masses. 

I have actually kind of started to like the movie more on retrospect. I want to watch it again and think about more on the Kens. I feel like there was more room left to ponder there.

Parts that were groundbreaking to me: having the quiet part said out loud about the double standards men have for women in a reasoned, articulated fashioned, having women of all races have each others‚Äô backs, and the focus on being supportive to each other, no matter how the other person looks. My partner told me he saw how deeply the movie hit me.

Parts that would have made my conservative mind recoil: having the quiet part said out loud in the first place, seeing women being supportive to each other, wondering what would happen to poor Ken, why didn‚Äôt Barbie pretend to like him, and the creator telling their creation they can decide for themselves.

Life really is what you make of it, and your goals and your choices.

If I'm overstepping/mansplaining by all means downvote me to oblivion to live with the Kens vaguely somewhere in Barbieland.

The movie said things I'd never personally heard from feminism, at least not explicitly. This may be a failing of my upbringing in northern NJ. But I've only ever heard how women deserve to pursue any path in life they want, usually stated as a doctor or lawyer, etc. The movie feels like the equivalent of that graphic tee that says ""there are 2 kinds of people: 1. Those who can extrapolate from data."" But actually saying the next line about those who can't. Of course women don't have to be anything other than themselves to matter. But I think esp with barbie who is a woman with many impressive jobs this message can get lost.

So I agree it's basic entry level feminism, but a message I think needs to be restated to a wider audience and Barbie was the perfect vehicle for it.

461,"I wasn't a huge fan of the coverage of feminism given that it's a film for people of all ages.

Tbh I enjoyed it, but I definitely understand where the families in my theatre were coming from when they walked out after expecting to see a fun Disney-esque kids movie, only to get what was essentially a more tame version of sitcom comedies such as Brooklyn99; which isn't really appropriate for children.

The couple sitting next to my fiancee and I were like ""What is this f\*cking bullshit?"" and I mean...if you grew up loving Barbie you were probably expecting a make-you-feel good with a moral message kids movie.

My fiancee enjoyed it as well, but even she wasn't a huge fan of just how much they focused on feminism and suggestive jokes over actually telling a story. Then again, it's a Barbie movie so idk how far they can go without recreating the early-2000s fairytale Barbie movie.

Also being trans...it wasn't enjoyable watching their selected trans model on screen. As much as I enjoy representation, it's just weird watching something so forced. I blame the screenwriter and not the model though, because the higher-ups definitely were like ""We need trans representation in this movie"". That said, I wish they had chosen a more reserved trans girl and not an OnlyFans model :/

Conflict with the Kens was lackluster, thought that could have easily been fixed by the marketing department trying a Ken push and would have given more of a point to the executive officers even being in the movie.

I think they could have done an interesting negative thesis statement spreading around Barbieland to brainwash the Kens and Barbies, because the way it is patriarchy just takes over for no reason? Because Ken is cool and main Barbie is the only one that can resist him?

The feminine double standard thesis as the fix for Barbieland doesn't do anything for me, because it's not the conflict of the movie so why is it the solution. And personally, while I appreciate that double standard, it's a very social media feminist problem, especially when all the double standards are piled up like that. Makes it less relatable, particularly because we don't actually see any characters experiencing the weight of these standards. 

I also think the ""Barbie is lame because she's a symbol of the patriarchy vs Barbie is becoming more than Stereotypical Barbie"" gets lost in the Barbie becomes human ending.

So yeah, it is good to spread the warning to younger women.

Over all it did nothing for me.

514,"The main one for me is just simple taste. That and I am a huge Christopher Nolan and Cillian Murphy fan, so Oppenheimer got 1000% of my focus when it came out.

I don't know if it's just a me thing or an autism thing, but humor is very hit or miss with me, so I'm not big on comedies to begin with. I prefer dark, serious films. Oppenheimer is the perfect example of a film that fits my personal preferences for what I enjoy out of films and while OF COURSE people can enjoy both films, Barbie just didn't fit my personal taste for the type of things I typically like to watch. 

I was also just never a Barbie person. Or a doll person at all. It was never my thing as a kid, so I don't have any nostalgia to draw from in regards to that.

I am extremely liberal and consider myself a feminist, so the message of the film was not an issue at all for me. The writing and the way it was presented didn't really do it for me, but again that might be more a taste issue. 

Also the marketing just was a little too in the face for me. And I found the way WB handled the situation of releasing the film on the same day as Oppenheimer and their weird hate boner for Christopher Nolan to be incredibly unprofessional and petty, and really just soured me towards them on that front. 

I also have a hard time getting over the feeling that Barbie, at the end of the day, was just a mechanism to rebrand Mattel as a cool new feminist brand. It felt at times like the film had a checklist of things to address, so Mattel can now say, ""see, we acknowledged this! Don't you love us now! Come buy our toys again!"" There were times where it felt almost like they were weaponizing feminism to sell toys. I don't doubt that those like Gerwig and Robbie were more genuine in the message the film was trying to convey, but from Mattel's side of things it just comes across as disingenuous. Ultimately, the packaging of the film is very enticing, but it's still at it's very core an ad to sell toys. 

I also just cannot help but already be exhausted at the mere thought of how many of these films they're going to make. Even if Gerwig and Robbie don't come back, WB and Mattel are going to be shoving Barbie movies down our throats for years, not to mention the other ten thousand toy based films Mattel has planned. I'm just so tired of cinematic universes at this point.

I also just want to say that I've sort of avoided talking about it in general with anyone who I know liked it, because I hate raining on other people's parades. I loved Oppenheimer and I know how sad it made me to see people bashing on it, so my general attitude is to keep my mouth shut unless I know I am around like minded people. So just know I'm not trying to make anyone feel bad about enjoying the film. I am so glad you liked it and it brought you joy.

The singing and dancing was excellent and just enough‚Ä¶..But calling this movie a feminist anthem??? Plleeaassee. Watching the Barbie movie was like going to a kids movie and expecting that there would be some thinly veiled jokes in there for the adults to be entertained as well, and instead being disappointed and bored‚Ä¶. 

Because it was a kids movie. By that I mean not necessarily targeted for kids, but so basic and obvious in its messaging that it‚Äôs plot was boring and without nuance. Greta Gerwig could have made her commercial hit and also had deeper topics and exploration there. Their budget was basically unlimited and she had a huge green light. Don‚Äôt Look Up was a recent Netflix film that did a great job of this. However, in Barbie, everything was just surface level. So while I appreciated the artistry of the movie‚Äôs creation and production, I found its plot pretty disappointing and uninspiring. 

Alsoooo, America Ferrera‚Äôs character (and her daughter) was totally superfluous and it would have been a better movie without her.

My reasoning of avoiding the movie during its hype is not because I think the movie itself will be bad. It‚Äôs because of the whole package it comes in.

I didn't dislike it, I found it enjoyable and fun, but I don't really like how it keeps being put up as some sort of extremely feminist movie when it's really not. It's extremely basic liberal feminism, doesn't really go into any sort of intersectionality either (I was a bit peeved at how there were several Barbies played by women of colour and one played by a trans actress, but there was absolutely zero mention of intersectionality or how their experiences might have been affected by this, I mean obviously in Barbieland it most likely wouldn't but it did talk about sexism in the real world, and especially the main non-Barbie character who did the whole monologue being Latina herself)

It kind of feels like for a lot of it they just checked off boxes for diversity but it kind of feels very flat. If it was a movie that was merely about Barbies being Barbies I would have loved to see this kind of casual representation (I do like how Hari Nef was a Barbie without her transness being a big deal tbh) but since it kind of was trying to be more than that it just ended up feeling a bit lacking.

And, to be clear, I was never expecting a film that is basically a glorified toy ad (an entertaining and interesting one, but it was Mattel being Mattel and capitalism being capitalism) be a super relevant work of feminist discourse, and I still liked it a lot and had fun, but I am kind of disappointed with how many people hyped it up as if it was the pinnacle of feminist thought or something.

I was surprised that I sobbed during the movie but honestly it was saying out loud and painting the picture of what it is like to be a woman in our society. I was actually hearing it out loud and it hit a cord. So many young woman need to wake the fuck up. I have always been a bit of an alien having raised myself in a very misogynist family (boys were sent to college, girls thrown out at 18 to go find husbands). I spend a decade in the military where men were in charge and then went into nursing afterward only to be mortified at the plight of woman in our country. Where as my mother generation were SAHM who couldn‚Äôt open bank accounts and were left with kids in abject poverty when the men left for other woman (yes the present day prejudice against men in family law came about after decades of woman being abandoned with kids and left poor). My generation was expected to do all my mother did plus work full time because a mans salary was no longer covering it and the economy demanded it. It wasn‚Äôt sustainable, Many of use went into our first marriage with all the brain washed roles in our head. Doing all the household labor, the kid care, and worked full time still treating our spouses like children who shouldn‚Äôt have to be bothered other then going to work. After nursing school I realized that literally 80% of my class left their husbands afterward. Even with a job he became the liability, the one thing that could go that just might lesson our loud just a little. To hell with his money. This does not even touch on realizing how horrible the work force was for woman. My first RN job I was making 12.50 an hour in 1998! To start. The woman at home wallpapering my kitchen was making $25 and she didn‚Äôt have to worry about killing anyone. I watch young woman repeat the same shit over and over. God forbid they stand up for themselves. I know some are scared. My two daughter try their hardest not to think about the impeding doom they feel as their rights are chipped away. They vote but have such anxiety. And yet I see them putting their husbands first and not owning their own power the way they should because they were raised in a culture where woman are not worthy and don‚Äôt even exist unless they are tied to a man.

I didn't feel like anyone really had a heartfelt journey and I ended not caring so much about Barbie and the mom and daughter, who should have been the main characters. 

The best character was ken. Because he was interesting, it was really well acted and he had his own songs, he actually had an emotional journey and learned something. But it's a bit weird that in a so called feminist movie the best written character is a man. 

Also he basically enslaved the Barbies which they thought was fine which was a weird choice story wise to a degree. I understand that it was pointing out how women don't understand themselves sometimes that they are being opressed but in the real world this has happened over thousands of years. And in this story it almost felt like you could interpret it as their ""nature"" or as that they are just easily manipulated. So bad message in my opinion. 

And then he never really gets punished. He doesn't get the girl and we have to feel bad for him? There were basically no consequences for his actions. And there were all kinds of these kind of off messages.

Between races, healthy or more unique ppl, rich and poor etc. It was never mentioned. It made it all really distort from the reality and in my eyes thats why it also partly misrepresented the conflict. It simplified it a lot. Too much. Okay I am going to be provocative. For me the best kind of feminist is one that counts everything in and fights because of that for her values. Not like i m a white feminist but I could be very much very racist because fuck them I don t see the parallels of oppression. Like some feminist in the 19th century germany I believe argued that they should have more rights because you know, you shouldn‚Äôt place them in one level with black people that would be insulting. Yes the film isn‚Äôt racist, but just ignoring these conflicts is also really bad in my opinion, because then it distorts the problem since it focussed one single thing and then ignores when oppression crosses/ works together. Like sexism between races. Men that only respect ‚Äûtheir‚Äú women. Etc. Research my knowledge please ^^‚Äò hope you ppl get what I m trying to say. (Of course its also a problem when ignoring the problems is that you seem like egoistically only caring for your problem, and when you again provocatively said a rich pretty white women than you don‚Äôt have much to care, and it make you seem a lot like it, but I think the whole blm and the metaphor with the burning house is all in our mind.

Just my 2 cents on more productive discourse and not allowing reactionaries/marketing to force a narrative.",2023-07-23 13:48:09,321,TrueFilm,xylog,comment,The Barbie movie to me seemed to be supportive for BOTH men and women. I do not understand the backlash.

Hit every other point on the head as well. I think people are just not happy when faced with the truth.

4,"I‚Äôm not saying I agree with this (so please don‚Äôt guilt by association downvote me lol), but here‚Äôs how I perceive some could read into it that way:

The setup is that the Kens are disenfranchised in the Barbie world - they aren‚Äôt to have careers or homes or any positions of power. They in turn rebel against this but are complete idiots. This is of course meant to mirror our current society - idiot men in charge. The Barbies are smarter and then just take power back, crippling the dumb men again and not really giving them any power, but now it‚Äôs justified because the men tried to take over. The film also justifies it by saying the men don‚Äôt really want power to begin with. The positive for the men is the end is that they have more insight into their own behavior, insight only given to them by the smarter women, so they can live more fulfilled lives but are back to being disenfranchised (they just deserve it). 

The movie isn‚Äôt really fair to the Kens in that they are legitimately victims in the world as it is first portrayed, but they are just total idiots so they deserve it. When otherwise shouldn‚Äôt they *want* to rebel against a world where they are offered nothing? Is that really a fully satisfying ending when looking it with that lens of its portrayal of men?",2023-07-23 03:01:41,128,TrueFilm,JuanJeanJohn,comment,The Barbie movie to me seemed to be supportive for BOTH men and women.

8,"The movie makes perfect sense if you believe that men and women are essentially the same. 

If you decided to go for the Barbenheimer experience, here's a ready-made good example‚Äîin Oppenheimer, how many women were in important roles? Generals, presidents, scientists, etc? They were love interests certainly, but if there were no women to speak of, could you have still made a compelling movie about the creation of the atomic bomb? It seems like you could, and this is based on *real life*. 

If you are a well-meaning person and an egalitarian, how do you explain such discrepancies? There are really two categories of blame‚Äîexternal factors and internal factors. 

If you blame internal factors, such as preference, hormones, psychology, or biology, there is a risk of offending women generally, that inequality might be because of them in some part. You can always point to exceptions like Marie Curie or Ada Lovelace as counterexamples. 

And, without question, there *have* been external factors to blame. A society that does not permit the education of women, or allow them to vote, or to own property, of course has social barriers against them becoming great scientists and leaders. Modern technology has done a lot to liberate women from strictly being mothers and homemakers‚Äîelectric machines that perform household duties, an information-focused economy that requires less manual labor, and wide access to birth control. It's no coincidence that these developments were in place before a women's movement could be successful. 

But! Under the law, women's rights have largely been achieved. (There could be an argument against that relating to the repeal of Roe vs Wade, but that is a recent development.) How can we explain now that there aren't as many great women scientists, CEOs, chess champions, etc? 

Again, if you don't wish blame any kind of internal factors, it *must* be because we haven't **really** achieved social equality, and that is the ""Patriarchy"" exaggerated to comical levels in the film:

* Barbie is immediately and aggressively harassed by multiple men upon entering the real world. 

* She is arrested for defending herself, and the cops make piggish comments toward her. 

* Mattel is led by a room entirely of incompetent men, while a smart lady manages the door. 

* Ken is told at one point, ""We still do Patriarchy here, we just hide it really well."" 

Now here is where interpretation of the film is important‚Äîdo the filmmakers intend to show that these kinds of examples are close to actual events that happen in reality, or are they wildly exaggerated for comic effect? (It's obviously not altogether literal, as you could take a look at the compositions of Mattel's [corporate leadership](https://corporate.mattel.com/executive-leadership) and [board of directors](https://corporate.mattel.com/investors/corporate-governance/board-of-directors) to see.) If you are a man, depending on how you might take it, it could feel as though the movie is accusing you unfairly. 

Barbie The Movie has a strong perspective, clearly, but I am glad you pointed out there is a redemption arc for the men as well. It treats their feelings as important too, and we get to see things from their perspective as well as the women's perspective. In fact, I think this is exactly what elevates the film and stops it from being propaganda, unlike a more mean-spirited movie like Don't Worry Darling, where the men are contemptible and villainous through and through.",2023-07-23 18:02:03,31,TrueFilm,lintamacar,comment,The Barbie movie to me seemed to be supportive for BOTH men and women.

In the middle he's showed doing a duo lingo lesson learning Spanish on his own, he's doing the work, and then at the end they make him say the phrase wrong and have America and the daughter roll their eyes at his stupidity. To me it's kind of men bashing because I think in the real world either he would actually know the phrase or be self aware enough not to use it, but because he has to be dumb, he can't get it right. It's a little thing I know, but to me it just kinda shows yeah Kens are all dumb but men in the real world are too and women put up with them. I really don't feel like the developed America Ferrera's character enough, I would have liked them to show some more of her struggles to relate to, but I think it's just because they put a lot of plot and scenes in the movie so they had to keep it moving.",2023-07-23 18:23:11,17,TrueFilm,Puzzleheaded_Act_985,comment,The Barbie movie to me seemed to be supportive for BOTH men and women.

""We definitely would do better by just being happy with ourselves"". I don't think you realize what effort it takes to know yourself so deeply, as to be be happy with yourself. Do you see any 40 year olds being drawn to Andrew Tate? He appeals to children, and immature men. And you have to have fucked up very bad, or, unfortunately, have had shit stacked up against you so bad to be that immature once you exit your mid 30s. It is a lifelong journey to get to know yourself

Don't beat yourself up too much. You *are* happy for your friends with great salaries, you're just a bit misdirected by the unfortunate circumstance that you don't yet have one.

If you can't laugh along at being the butt of the type of joke that was levied at the opposite gender for years than you need to grow a pair of balls. 

This movie is basically a modern animal house for girls. If you can't laugh along with it because you feel misrepresented, reduced  or just left out, then I'm not sure you're the objective empath you think you are.

I just wish that Greta hit a little more on what makes the patriarchy bad for men too.

I feel like the main takeaway from a man‚Äôs POV is that men are not defined by the women they can get. An important message for sure, especially in the Tate era. However she touched on other, larger issues the patriarchy imposes on men (violence toward each other, holding in emotions) without crossing the finish line on them.

17,"This movie wore the aesthetic of wokeness in order to create a crowd pleasing movie that appeals to Mattel‚Äôs target audience (and allow them to update the Barbie brand). It did not actually give a meaningful or insightful take on the politics it criticized, which to me, came off as hugely disingenuous.

It called out capitalism and consumerism, but then proceeded with its own capitalistic and consumerist motivations. It called out patriarchy, but caricaturized patriarchy as frat bros drinking brewskis (which makes it that much harder for general audiences to see the true insidiousness of systemic patriarchy).

Likewise, it portrays progressive values, but doesn‚Äôt really live by them. Ken, upon being defeated, acts like a crybaby. It was essentially a scene that actively shamed men for crying, while the dialogue was talking about how crying is okay. The movie was completely unaware of how it perpetuated all of the tropes it was trying to advocate against.

Honestly super disappointing.

I think men should be able to cry. I think we should welcome it in society. But allowing men to cry is not only a ‚Äúmen‚Äù issue. The stories we tell, the way we treat men, the way we see men, all push boys away from thinking it‚Äôs okay to cry. This was just one such scene in Barbie but the whole movie felt similarly stupid, actively working against the values it claimed to be supportive of.

19,"I legitimately think the Ken subplot of the movie is goddamn brilliant. You summarized the themes very well and I can‚Äôt add much to your analysis, although I do want to take a moment to appreciate the meta-context *Barbie* plays on by casting Ryan Gosling. 

For years he‚Äôs played roles of the long-suffering, stoic badass who is mistreated by society but is rewarded with the affection of a woman. His performances are often great in those movies, and some of the movies themselves are great. But those films can be interpreted in such a way that supports the problematic narrative that‚Äôs fed to troubled young men: that if you are a morally upright person, you are entitled to a woman‚Äôs love and attention. His characterization in these films like *Drive*, *The Place Beyond the Pines*, and *Blade Runner 2049* is so stereotyped it‚Äôs become a meme. Spend any time on r/moviescirclejerk and you‚Äôll see reference to it as ‚ÄúLiterally Me,‚Äù as in ‚ÄúRyan Gosling‚Äôs character is a perfect representation of the way society mistreats me.‚Äù 

Casting Gosling as Ken is a stroke of genius because they take this meme to the next level by portraying the world view of the lonely, misogynistic men who craved female attention and satirizing the hell out of it, thus taking away its power. It‚Äôs now hard for people to look at the characters Gosling played in the past as a figurehead for the incel movement and not feel a little ridiculous. Every call of ‚Äúhe‚Äôs literally me‚Äù can be answered with ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just Kenough.‚Äù 

My guess is this will have a few types of reactions from the people who label *Barbie* as man-hating: some will defend Gosling, like he is literally the one being disenfranchised not just his character; and others will disavow him for ‚Äúgoing woke.‚Äù The result will be in-fighting and further fracturing those communities WHICH IS WHAT THE MOVIE PROPOSES AS THE SOLUTION TO DISMANTLING THE INEQUITABLE SYSTEM WE HAVE.

to be a metaphor for women under patriarchy the barbies have to be the villains. but the kens and the rl men are also the villains, although kens are doofus villains. This is probably because you can't torpedo the brand or say ""hey, women can be bad too!""

the barbies really cant be villains at all, which makes the kens more negative to compensate and points to fall flat. you cant make a metaphor for oppression a brainless himbo easily conquered by appealing to his vanity.

That's the main root of all conservative, gender-essentialist ""outrage"", ""backlash"" and conflict. Barbie is getting a lot of attention and promotion. It's become a bit of a cultural phenomenon, especially among younger and left-leaning people, women and queers. So professional conservatives can parasitically piggy-back on that attention and get some easy publicity, and money, by feigning outrage and generating baseless controversy. 

That's pretty much all that's happening. The same for most of the ""debate"" around trans rights, women's rights, LGBTQ+ issues, civil rights, climate change etc. Plus, for professional conservatives whose wealth and success is propped up by unjust societal power structures, there's personal gain in encouraging wider opposition to social change that may threaten their unearned privilege.",2023-07-23 15:40:47,5,TrueFilm,Junior-Watercress-99,comment,The Barbie movie to me seemed to be supportive for BOTH men and women.

They think the only people who don‚Äôt subscribe to the status quo of hollow, divisive identity politics must be loud, hateful alt-right monsters, when the truth is that the overwhelming silent majority have no time for that nonsense, and don‚Äôt dwell on it, but you better believe they take notice when the Hollywood media apparatus belittles their demographic a few dozen too many times.

The idea this movie insists on beating us over the head with, that half the population of the most privileged society in human history is being systematically oppressed by the other half, is a comically absurd one that has nonetheless been the de facto gospel of post-secondary Humanities for decades thanks to Marxist bullies and thugs forcing any ideological dissent out of the institution. It doesn‚Äôt make it true, nor above debate, and the majority of the population who have used their brains for the occasional non-partisan perception of the world around them, and who have matured mentally since their freshman year, reject it because it doesn‚Äôt reflect reality.

We‚Äôll never know exactly how big a slice of the country doesn‚Äôt buy into Barbie‚Äôs toxic bullshit, because most people are passive consumers and not shrill activists.

We don't live in a world where all women have ""no power"". We may not have reached complete equality, but we're at least on the way towards it. This film presented 2023 as being 1923, where all men are sexist demeaning assholes and all women are helpless victims. Women are not all helpless victims, and not all men are sexist assholes.  


Unfortunately, the ending message of the film wasn't that the real world needs equality. 

Barbieland, was ""fixed"" by returning to a matriarchy, and so logically because the real world is ""opposite in every way"", doesn't that mean that the real world would need to be fixed by being a patriarchy!?!

47,"I tend to agree with you, OP. For me, it felt a little bit like the male issues were played for laughs. Will Ferrell wanting to have physical contact with other men in a playonic way was a joke, accented with a mildly homophobic? punchline. I mean, no male CEO would crave physical contact with other men without being a gay, right?/s 

Ken, unable to contain his emotions, running off to have a cry, was portrayed as a silly crybaby boy; even though Barbie said it was okay to cry, it was immediately turned into a joke, where her emotional moments were poignant, intimate, and moving.

It felt that way throughout, to me. Yes, the message seemed very supportive and surprisingly aware of emotional and mental struggles men go through, but it was always punctuated with a silly gag. 

In such a divisive world we're living in, it's no wonder conservative bros are lashing out. I doubt most of them have seen it though.

After kind of talking through my feelings with my wife, I came to terms with that it wasn't intentionally being hurtful to men. It just played it a lot sillier than Barbie's issues. I cried when Barbie visited the maternal figure. I envied her that female sensitivity. Mostly with Ken, I just thought he was being a goof.

And isn't it a nice thing that it gave me and my wife a moment to talk about some of our issues?

49,"In Barbieland, Barbie has never really known that she wasn't in charge. The roles completely flipped when she entered the ""real world"". In Barbieland, Ken is a representative of what roles women play in the real world. I found this fascinating. He was created ONLY for Barbie to gaze upon him when the mood strikes HER.  \*ever felt like that, ladies? How interesting! And when he got to the ""real world"" and realized he was the one with more power, he thought it felt GREAT!  When Barbie was created, she was a symbol of all the things women could be after a world where women were really limited in roles. My mom could be A) a MOM. B) An offiice assistant. C) a nurse. D) A librarian. E) A teacher. Of course, some women broke those expectations, but this was the general norm. Barbie came along at a time when little girls would begin to grow up with different ideas for their future. As time went on and things evolved and girls grew up without questioning if the could be whatever they wanted, Barbie lost her original symbolism. The idea of her didn't age well. Her bar was suddenly LOW when it used to be so, sooo high! There are many nuggets that come to me from this movie that I only understand after the fact. It's a real thinker. I dont think it's so black and white as to be a ""man hating"" movie. Or woke. Or too feminist. Or anything. Misogyny is so complex and layered and really supported by men and women alike, even if they don't realize it. I have done or said things against women to better hang with the boys. I have thought it was better to be that way.  How many of us have said things as teens like ""I just like guys more. They're easier"". UGH... anyway, this is a tangent, but I did find it all so fascinating and if you're a thinker and open to it, I think everyone should see it.

I enjoyed it overall. I'm not a fan of the preachier political moments, but the action and comedy stuff was great. I loved the Ken scenes more, but that's because I never got Margot Robie's appeal, and I don't know any of the other barbies. I recognized America Carrera, though. I think Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu were good. Maybe because I'm more comedy-oriented or maybe because they're guys and I have a bias.

It'll please the people who already like the message and drive away anyone who need to be ""shown not told"". 

My personal issue with the movie is that it's just fundamentally a badly written movie without a coherent story or consistent, developed characters. Barbie is the hero, but she's lacking depth or character or a real journey that makes any level of sense. The other characters' motivations and storylines are also incoherent and they're never developed enough as characters for me to care deeply about what happens to them. The average kids movie has a better storyline and characters than this one.

In the end the reactionaries achieve total victory with almost no concessions to the marginalized group of revolutionaries. Oh, and Barbie is allowed to be her depressed self so long as it generates profits for the aforementioned corporate overlords. 

I also didn‚Äôt like that the Barbies defeat the Kens through emotional manipulation. Why did the filmmakers feel like they needed to use a negative stereotype associated with women as the Barbies means to victory over the patriarchy?

The strength of a women should not be displayed as coming from hurting/belittling men. This next generation of children will now grow up with this idea from movies that in order for women to have power we must mistreat men thanks to this movie and so many more. This is a deeper problem too in case no one has noticed, it‚Äôs a problem because lately this seems to be the topic in every new movie the super Mario bros, Barbie, and even that new Snow White movie (it‚Äôs almost brainwashing to see how forced this agenda is). Why not just be original and make a movie where women are the strong figures/characters like Sarah Conner, Alice from resident evil, or even Merida from Brave.

Yes, the movie is not man hating in the sense that it wants to say ""men bad,"" but like you described it: ""The Kens were all competing against each other, in this toxic struggle that I feel like a lot of men struggle with. Societal expectations often pushes men to want to be better than other men. It's like a constant struggle to need to get validation by competing against other guys. It seems men more often than women struggle with finding importance in their life and feeling valued. Part of that is feeling the need to find a beautiful woman to feel validation"" - some people genuinely disagree with that narrative, me included. I don't like the notion of generalizing men as some sad, pathetic creatures, that have nothing better or more interesting to do in life than competing with each other (and I don't mean the interesting competition, i.e. sports, competitive video games etc., because obviously that wasn't about it) and chasing some women (and yes, I'm a heterosexual guy) and need to be coddled by some basic Hollywood summer flick telling them ""they're enough"" because obviously without it they wouldn't know any better. It's the same with all that ""societal expectations"" and ""gender norms"" crap, nobody is forced to be or do anything, all these expectations and norms are just words that a bunch of normies believe in, every normal person simply ignores them and/or laughs them off as some irrelevant normie shit, to make the people who believe in it even more mad. The last thing I want anyone to think is that I feel ""oppressed"" by this sort of stuff and want some movie to validate me.

Ok? Then what? Reality doesn't work that way. Real life doesn't work that way. Saying fluff words don't solve real issues and fix anything.

The worst part of the movie is attributing those to the wrong problems. The ideas of ""patriarchy"" and ""equality"" exists and many times it exists for reasons this movie didn't talk about and quite honestly might have no idea about, but act like it knows the solution for it.

The real world and Barbie world are nothing alike in parallel or in opposites. Barbie world is supposed to represent the real world but in reverse and it's horrible at that. It's a fun world on its own but it doesn't try to stay just that.

I especially felt that the speech of barbie exists without a counterweight, leaving Ken (and therefore men) speechless. 
Therefore I decided to balance it out by giving Ken a voice as well. 
I imagined a conversation about unrealistic role expectations that Barbie could have had with Ken, just for both to find out that their struggles overlap significantly. 
Being convinced that due to acknowledging and better understanding each other, society can truly move forward. In the end, nobody is (or can be) perfect, since we‚Äôre all (just) humans‚Ä¶

79,"I fully agree. 

As a man I didn't see anything wrong with the movie representation of men. There were many critiques of very common silly, and some toxic, traits that are very common to men, but I didn't see any of them aimed against men as a whole. And some of them were even presented in a loving funny way.

To me Ken was the star of the movie. He was silly, but he was also lovable and humane. He was ultimately a man in love who didn't have the courage to express his feelings or emotional intelligence to deal with them. The same issues almost all of us struggle with. He also showed very good character development as the movie went on, and got a LOT of screen time.

The only real problem of representation in the movie I see is among the class structure. Representation of the social and cultural minorities was great, and that's good. It is clear the movie is with the powerless minorities. The problem is when it completely ignores the existence and life of the economic majority without power in the system. The only working class people in the entire movie were the sexist construction workers who were portrayed in an extremely bad light. It's almost as if the message of the movie was: it's ok if you're black, white, gay, trans, indigenous, weird and whatever, but only as long as you a subject of corporate slavery and submit to the commodity fetishism we're selling.",2023-08-19 19:34:26,1,TrueFilm,voinekku,comment,The Barbie movie to me seemed to be supportive for BOTH men and women.

80,"Men aren't competing with other men, men just work. They changed beauty standards for women to feel more comfortable, but there aren't any overweight male models on the men's magazines because men aren't competitive in that way. We idolize success, we don't want to lower the standard to make ourselves feel comfortable. That transcends to most things in men's lives. Most workplace deaths are men, men lose their children the most in court (even though they are statistically the better parent), men die in wars the most, men die protecting their families the most, men are less likely to futher their education, men are more likely to be homeless. Being a man is about being strong enough to make difficult sacrifices to provide for the ones you love, while simultaneously accepting that society is widely against you. Men and women are not the same, we never will be, and there is nothing wrong with that. We keep our mouths shut and just do our best. Just being a man and man up, that's enough.

83,"I didn't think it was anti-men as much as overestimating it's understanding of men (a common theme I find probably mirroring real life) while failing to acknowledge flaws in women. The implication is that women have this deep understanding of men and that society is by driven by women placating the egos of men. While this is true in situations, the reverse is also true. Every stereotyped ""male"" behavior is also done by women. I've been ""mansplained"" things by women. I've been given unsolicited career advice from women. I've seen women fish for compliments regarding their looks/talents, and get quite offended if you don't comply. Society weirdly doesn't consider it offensive when women do these same negative behaviours though, while men everywhere are on thin ice. It delves into the most negative aspects of male psychology, presents a extreme caricature as the standard, while ignoring the negative aspects of the female psyche (insecurity, overestimation of emotional intelligence, the desire for ""oneuppance"", and the tendency for massive group think... Ironically all of which was actually present in this movie but not addressed). My wife snickered and pointed out to me that I serenaded her with a guitar at our wedding. I turned around and pointed out that not only was it her idea, she also picked out what song she wanted me to sing... A small detail something that this movie seems to want her to forget.

The other is that the movie can be confusing to people that see Barbie as woman, and Ken as man.

96,"The themes you found were good, but IMO they weren't executed well. the ""I am Kenough"" is a good message to push, but you need to lay the foundation that Ken feels that he is attached to Barbie. At least for me, for most of the movie, it just felt that he had feelings for Barbie and also he liked how respected he was in the real world. Those themes, to me, lead to a statement on gender inequality. Instead, we get the president barbie outright rejecting the Kens, and without remorse as well. Also, because of this lead up, the ""I am Kenough"" felt more harmful than helpful. It's kind of like if a woman complains to you about how unfairly she's treated, about how she's harassed and not taken seriously purely because she's a woman, and then in response she gets ""You're enough as you are."" Again, good theme, bad execution IMO. I personally agree that some if not a lot of the criticism is misognystic. I think the set-up where the Kens were mistreated in Barbieland was a perfect way to setup a gender inequality scenario with something that makes sense (as you said, Kens aren't as popular as Barbies). Also, there were just some fun scenes and some really funny moments as well (I loved the choreographed Ken song scene, and I loved the opening scene with all the Barbies going ""Hi Barbie""). I just think that it was disappointing that such a good set up had such a poor conclusion. 

Also, on your point about the Kens supreme court thing. One other issue is that Barbieland is supposed to be this utopia. Everyone is happy every day, no one dies or even thinks about death, etc. The main problem originally is the disregard for the Kens, which to me, is a perfect way to introduce gender issues in a Barbie movie. However, at the end, we don't get a happy ending. We get something that feels like it's a ""gotcha"" moment because it mirrors the real world. The thing is, we don't want our utopia to mirror the real world. If we did, Barbie would have been fine with staying a Barbie and not being a real human. Barbie is meant to be the best of women originally and then should've branched out to be the best of what humans can be in general. I think that's why people, including me, have some problems with the movie.

100,"That's my takeaway as well, on what Greta Gerwig wants to convey with the film:

\- The ""patriarchy"" movement in the Barbie world is an inverted parallel of the ""extreme feminism"" movement in the real world which demands equality for the sake of equality.   
Gerwig wants to address that equality for the sake of equality is not healthy. The movie ends with the Kens getting an ""opportunity"" to prove themselves rather than outright forced equality, one point that the non-extreme feminism movement in the real world is fighting for.

\- Fake political correctness for the sake of business: Shown in the comical performance by Will Ferrel of the Mattel CEO; The CEO prioritizes profits and sacrifices people (and Barbies), while constantly denying it; The CEO markets Barbie as a n-led company while all the boards are male;

\- Painful realization after innocent illusion: Barbie coming to the real-world aims to portray how children, especially girls, often have a painful realization that the world isn't as dreamy as it was told by the children-aimed advertisement and products, and, manufactured social silo (portrayed by in-movie Barbie as a product and the Barbieland).

\- Self-worth bound to the other sex's opinion. While in the movie, the unemployed Ken is the most affected, it is actually not a sex-specific phenomenon in the real world. Gerwig wants to highlight that this is unhealthy towards humans regardless of gender.

The hate seems to come from people who don't understand the film's metaphoric and satirical approach.

sexist for me because we see the reverse of women and men today, oppenheimer and barbie almost have contrasting audiences 65% dominated by either sex. (65% female for barbie and 65% male for oppenheimer). Barbie has a female dominated story. Oppenheimer has a male dominated story

This is allowing for everyone to have their own story but separately and that is ultimately what is sad. People are finding comfort in their own company instead of each other, as shown at the end of barbie

1,"I feel like the movie didn't actually deal with real feminist issues and was very glorified. The film basically boiled down the entire patriarchy as the Kens doing ""manly things"" like horses beer and trucks, which doesn't actually show any of the problems that stem from patriarchal society. There were also no redeemable male characters, every man was either a complete idiot, a joke, or a sexual harasser. Even the father, who could have been used to contrast the other male characters and show how masculinity has developed in the modern world catches a cultural appropriation jab. 

The movie acts like women today in the real world face the same level of oppression as the Kens in Barbieland so it's justified, but it fails to show just how much society has changed to make things more equal. Instead of acknowledging all the progress towards equality today, the movie dismisses all the positive changes as ""it's the same but we can just hide it better"". Thus the ending feels overly cynical and unnecessary, even though it is a gender swapped mirror to feminist movements in real life.

It also mixes up class issues and characterises them as gender issues. The idea of an oppressive ruling class being overthrown by a minority class, which creates yet another oppressive ruling class is not a gender issue. The movie seems to oppose the idea of oppression, but also at the same time glorifies and promotes ideas such as voting suppression, manipulating minority classes to fight amongst themselves, and rigged politics. Anyone can agree that Barbieland is hinted to be the preferred alternative to Ken's Kingdom, but yet they are both oppressive ruling classes. The movie then puts a patriarchal spin on this to justify the ending as a historical allegory, but in my opinion it doesn't fit well because Barbie and Ken are not good mirrors to Men and Women IRL, it feels more like different social classes.

Mattel also joked around like ""hahah we are so capitalistic and evil"" but it's unironically true and people just ate it up, which is so capitalistic and evil.

2,"I think Barbie is a fascinating artifact tbh. As a movie itself it works, imo, in dealing with sensitive issues. The message is somewhat muddled because of a couple of things people's been mentioning in this thread, namely very stupid male characters (Allan almost got there to help with that but it wasn't quite enough). I liked the movie.

But I think by far the most interesting aspect to the whole thing are the implications involved in the production and the public's response. It is indeed a fucking toy commercial, Mattel's name is all over the thing, the movie is at peace with the fact that it was funded by a massive corporation. You can sort of see the script attempt to recognize this fact, it being very meta sort of achieves the same thing also (""hey, filmmaker here, I'm aware this movie is talking about social issues tied not only to gender but class division and capitalism, but what can you do eh? Here's another self-aware joke""). I think it was Sasha who even quoted the line ""Capitalism contains the seeds of its own destruction"". 

What I mean is that the movie knows capitalism is (a big) part of the issue, though it is never directly addressed as a problem either in the real or Barbie world, because of course it can't. This is at the end of the day, one of the most effective pieces of advertising in a while. It's a commercial that manages to get the ball rolling on the social discourse about gender equality, with many subtler critiques to capitalism, while still successfully pushing product for consumption.

4,"This is just my opinion but I kind of sit at a middle ground on the movie. Not outraged by any message or whatnot, whether I agree or disagree, it is what it is, but I do think one writing choice kind of throws off the internal logic of the movie in a way that bugs me from the perspective of what I believe they were trying to portray, and how it could‚Äôve better hit the mark.

It would‚Äôve been more interesting if the Kens actually had hidden talents to offer instead of really being idiot himbos. The whole idea behind much of the repression of women in certain roles was that they‚Äôre held back because they‚Äôre seen as generally incapable of these things. Of course, we‚Äôve now learned that women can be perfectly good at things like math or business. If Barbieland is a ‚Äúreversed‚Äù comparison to the real world before feminism, the ending IMO kind of justifies their repression. Obviously we shouldn‚Äôt let idiot Kens onto the Supreme Court, they‚Äôre stupid as hell. These are the justifications that society used against women, but in Barbieland they‚Äôre shown to be actually valid justifications. It would‚Äôve been more congruent and harsh if they showed that Kens were just as capable of doing jobs, but the Barbies were subverting their potential to continue the status quo. That‚Äôs where, honestly, I do buy a little bit of the ‚Äúanti-men‚Äù feelings on the movie. The joke that Kens (and by extension men) are idiots was too good for them to pass up to actually make them sympathetic victims and parallels to women in the real world. The result is mostly just Kens being the substitute for a joke that couldn‚Äôt be made about women IRL, and their victimhood is justified. Basically the Barbies are glorified in a way that we‚Äôd never glorify sexist men, because they‚Äôre actually super justified in limiting the Kens involvement in society.

That said, I‚Äôm a decently conservative dude and understand that the movie wasn‚Äôt made for me so I just had fun with the things I liked, saw it as a entertaining enough flic, and let it just be that.

5,"I believe Barbieland has some kind of unintentional matriarchy. It isn't until the ending that the Barbies realise how much the Kens have been suffering.

I also like how the ending isn't about instant equity, but more like a representation of how the real world could proceed, kinda. Ken will grow because Barbies now have empathy and understand them, contrasting how in real life women will also grow, not only by their inner strenght, but by men's empathy and understanding too. With a magical ""equity"" ending, all meaning would have beem erased.

>instead of pretending all the problems are Barbieland are solved, it shows they still have more work to do

Exactly. Now I also realise (your comments about Ken's perception about masculinity and patriarchy made me connect the dots, OP) that Barbies took all the power by the end because they probably saw that Kens still had ""more work to do"". Kens on Barbieland needed to understand themselves before taking power again - probably a reflection about how men in the real world (I'm a man) should reconsider our perception of masculinity too.

I truly believe that the people who didn't understand the movie's intentions probably didn't saw the movie, because there's no way you could finish Barbie and think something like ""it's anit-men"". Of course there are jokes about men, and I laughed my ass off with the Godfather one.

And it cant just be a marketing tool cause it was so subversive how they roasted Mattel , by making them non-threatening bumbling keystone cops. Take that you corporate fat cats! 

 But thankfully they weren‚Äôt important , what was really important was that the true feminist spirit of barbie lives on at Matell via her creator Ruth Handler, shes not just a toy , shes the embodiment of female self determination , luckily we know this because they clearly spelt it out for us.

And we know Barbie is feminist cause the movie had construction workers , who were sexist! And it used all sorts of feminist words , especially the feminist speech by a brown person directed to all the moms who thought Barbie wasnt a fashionable toy choice anymore. 
Worry no more, Its safe to skip that baby genius ipad construction kit and go full pink again cause barbie is relevant and no other moms will judge you.

Look at how subtle Parasite was, that's true sattire of social issues. 
There is something I did enjoy about the way in which the film was produced. It is serious, it takes itself seriously, something that new movies rarely do.

To be honest, no. This bears little relation to the way men treat women in the real world. There are millions of female doctors and pilots etc.

The film never fully makes sense of how Barbieland is a inverse/parallel to the real world and how is it something else. Barbieland isn‚Äôt really a parallel to the real world. Barbies are still the heroes of the film and of their world, even though on paper they hold all of the power and don‚Äôt share it with the men. They are never seen as villains in the film like men are. We‚Äôre supposed to cheer for the Barbies at every point of the movie, more or less, even though they‚Äôve disenfranchised half of their population. Why should we want them to take back power from the Kens? Sure, the Kens aren‚Äôt any better but how is the world they‚Äôve built any worse? It‚Äôs just as unequal, just with more horses lol.

That‚Äôs why the ‚ÄúBarbieland as parallel/inverse of our world‚Äù thing doesn‚Äôt really make sense. It isn‚Äôt as clean as that - women are simply victims in our world and heroes in theirs. Men are victims (but ones we laugh at) and then eventually villains in their world and then villains in our world. It isn‚Äôt a true clean reverse of roles and isn‚Äôt something the script really fully compensates for. It‚Äôs very muddled.

There is no reason for the Kens to have to wait for change like women have had to in our world. The Supreme Court joke setting up the whole idea that the Kens are still disenfranchised in their world makes zero sense and seems antithetical to the point of the ending. I think the film tries to be satisfying to the audience by offering some element of revenge and punishment for the Kens. And even moreso, it‚Äôs clearly trying to make a statement on our world by showing how long it took for women to even begin to have roles of any power or influence (and coming from a president that is a woman in Barbieland makes that case even louder). But it makes zero sense because the Kens weren‚Äôt responsible for anything that happens in the real world. And their rebellion against the Barbies is essentially justified by their disenfranchisement in their world. The movie uses Kens as standins for women in our world but also for men in our world - the script doesn‚Äôt ever make full sense for their dual, conflicting role in the film.

A better ending would‚Äôve just had Barbieland be actually equitable, not just going back to where it was rather than draw some parallel that doesn‚Äôt fully make sense. None of that has to matter if everyone gets to be equal, since who represents who in what reality becomes moot. If Barbieland is a fantasy world, let it be one where Barbies and Kens are truly equal.

I like the movie a lot and agree with its message. I think the intended message is what you‚Äôve stated in your OP and it‚Äôs obvious that is what the film is striving to say - anyone who is arguing otherwise is just being intentionally obtuse. Its heart is mainly in the right place, I think, I just think in execution it doesn‚Äôt always work or isn‚Äôt always consistent and sometimes sadly works against (or at least is in conflict) with its overarching message.",2023-07-25 14:16:31,18,TrueFilm,JuanJeanJohn,comment,Is the message of Barbie (2023) going over everyone‚Äôs heads?

However my issue is that the patriarchy is always viewed as negative and therefore male success is viewed as negative. 

It‚Äôs important to ask WHY their is a ‚Äúpatriarchy‚Äù (and patriarchy only really refers to the positions of power in the workforce which is only one realm/aspect of life). Is there a patriarchy because men and the system they‚Äôve created are corrupt, misogynistic, and even evil? Or is it because men find a deep sense of meaning and purpose through their work and as a result devote more time and effort than most women do to their career? 

Why do men dominate the workforce? I say it‚Äôs because work and labor keep our world functioning, and work and labor is Mens specialty. Women have different specialties, such as nurturing children, creativity, adding emotion/passion when beneficial, and so much more. Men build a house best, but women make a house a Home. With that said, women aren‚Äôt appreciated enough for their domestic duties and services as mothers and wives, so much so that just saying women should fulfill domestic duties is seen as disrespectful.

27,"I think a lot of people have forgotten what satire is.
Some people are digging deep into the logistics and world consistency of a film and straight up tells you it is  an on the nose satirical piece. Then some other people are completely ignoring and even beating on Gerwig, because the film also doubles as a commercial.

I do agree that the film is kinda disgusting if you step back and realise that it is just a toy commercial. But if you step even further back you can see a promising direction with a strong opinion and something to say.

If you step even further back you see a woman utilizing what is basically a commercial to reach as many people as she can with an urgent message. You can see an artist violently reacting to some seriously horrible things happening in her country. You can see a clear but nuanced look into a problem. A piece that speaks deeply to a lot of people. An artist utilizing consumerism as a weapon and trying her best to not fall under the train herself

If you step even more away you see a film satirizing film history and tying that into its themes.

If you then step to the edge you see that even the most popular and recognized and respected new directors have to bow to commercialism if they want to make film. You can see the sad state of cinema and a director that despite all those hurdles still managed to make a smart, thoughtful film and also successfully commented on the history and negative and positive aspects of the product she is selling.

Barbie is by no means a perfect movie, but I feel like a lot of the criticisms it gets are in mean spirits and targeted because the film is feminist.
If you ask me, directors like Nolan are far more capitalistic and sinister and have nothing interesting to say. Oppenheimer is far more a status quo supportive work for both politics and cinema then Barbie, even thou Barbie is literally a commercial.",2023-07-26 02:22:13,3,TrueFilm,serugolino,comment,Is the message of Barbie (2023) going over everyone‚Äôs heads?

28,"Sure, I think you make some great points, but there's two elements you might be missing.

First... is the gender discrimination portrayed as very wrong? I mean, Women aren't intellectually inferior. Kens actually are consistently portrayed as such. We don't see much hidden talent in them, there isn't a big reveal, they ARE idiots, by and large. The message changes from ""These people aren't actually inferior"" to ""OK, they are, but be nice to them.""

And in that light, the Supreme Court reaction seems quite different. It's a humorous joke, not a real injustice we should see. We should be nice to Kens, they have inherent value, but don't ACTUALLY trust them to be on the Supreme Court.

Second, the second act analysis seems a little weird. If we follow the themes, it would seem to imply that women and the feminist movement, represented by the Kens, are trying to take things too far the other direction. But, and maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think that's the intended message, which kind of leaves the analogy in a weird place.",2023-07-25 13:28:26,3,TrueFilm,Happy-Viper,comment,Is the message of Barbie (2023) going over everyone‚Äôs heads?

29,"My issue with this is that it's never established who's supposed to represent who 

So in Barbie world everything is the opposite. Meaning, as you said, that Barbies, women, are on top, they rule over the Ken's who are barely seen as objects. So in this case the Barbies represent the men in the real world and the way they behave

Then the Kens ""rebel"" and install their own ruling over the Barbies. Except now all of a sudden, THEY are the ones who represent men in the real world and how they treat women

Then at the end, it flips back to the Barbies being in power, they don't allow for the Ken's to do anything. And this happens because that's how women are still treated in the real world today. So now Barbies are supposed to represent men again, and their behaviors

Barbie puts a mirror up to society in the first 10 minutes and then never expands on it, just flips Barbies and Kens and their roles in Barbie World. Even at the end, everything goes back to how it was. If that is the point of the movie, we didn't need nearly 2 hours to say it

I thought Barbie becoming self conscious and human was an amazing story beat and even her struggles as a woman in the real world, while exaggerated, were pretty fun, but the whole Barbie World tyranny from both sides didn't sit well with me because it didn't seem to show any redeeming qualities for Barbies or Kens. If it was shown that Barbies recognized an equal society was necessary and that both Barbies and Kens were capable and could complement each other, then maybe we could have gotten to a place of ""And hey, maybe this will happen in the real world"" instead of ""Ahah dumb Kens can't do anything""",2023-07-25 15:58:37,2,TrueFilm,mexploder89,comment,Is the message of Barbie (2023) going over everyone‚Äôs heads?

I do agree so many movies reviews are so politicized now that people may even love it or hate it based solely on the message. You look at movies reviews by users on say IMDB and half of them are like what is this woke crap even movies that dont really have much of a message. I find it unfortunate that partisanship has bled into so many parts of life. For me I wouldn't give it a good review because it didn't keep me engaged.

32,"Some of Barbie's ideas might go over people's heads, while others may simply disagree or dislike the concept. Personally, I'm often critical of these ideas, particularly when they pertain to issues like feminism, masculinity, capitalism, and patriarchy, as seen in some movies like Barbie. My dissatisfaction stems from the oversimplification of complex problems, treating them as if they were trivial both in the media and in real life.

Feminism, for instance, has undergone significant changes. In the past, it had more unity and was primarily focused on equality. Today, however, it has become multifaceted and sometimes problematic. Some still push for genuine equality and address real issues, while others advocate for equality in ways that can harm women. For example, I've spoken to feminists who believe that there shouldn't be separate gender sports teams and that men and women should compete against each other in MMA, soccer, football, etc. This approach, in pushing for equality, could be detrimental to women.

Unfortunately, there are also factions within feminism that harbor resentment towards men due to personal bad experiences, leading to generalizations and stereotypes. This kind of attitude can drive people away from the movement. Others may exploit feminism for power or financial gain or to further their political agendas. Still, others engage with feminism superficially, either to appear virtuous or even as a way to attract romantic partners. This last group is often seen as disingenuous, adopting the persona of the ""nice guy"" who wonders why his proclaimed feminism doesn't make him more appealing to women.

Many feminists overlook other critical factors such as biology, environmental influences, family background, religion, culture, financial well-being, and more. These elements play a significant role in the choices women make in their careers. The notion of patriarchy isn't the sole reason why many women become nurses, nor is it purely about biological predispositions. There are various intertwined reasons at play, and understanding them requires a more nuanced and comprehensive approach.

Patriarchy alone isn't what's preventing women from attaining positions of power in America, nor is it entirely nonexistent. The issue is multifaceted. While some feminists argue that patriarchy is the sole barrier and highlight male transgressions, there are myriad factors involved. Factors such as financial stability, biology, family background, religion, culture, lack of experience or education ‚Äî whether by choice or circumstance ‚Äî and even a lack of aspiration for power positions can play a role. The issue isn't as straightforward as patriarchy alone. 

This isn't to deny that some men suppress women. I've witnessed men pushing women down. However, I've also seen women undermine other women. Personally, I've been held back by both men and women from raises and advancements. I've even faced sexual harassment from a female boss and know others who have experienced similar situations, including women harassed by other women. The takeaway here is that individuals, regardless of gender, can oppress others when given  power. 

This leads me to my critique of Barbie's portrayal of feminism and patriarchy. Its approach to these themes is overly simplistic, shallow, and ultimately dull. The movie attempts to comment on capitalism, but it felt restrained, as if it was holding back its more incisive critiques. Its message ended up being so lackluster that it lulled some of  my family members to sleep. While the first half of the film was engaging, it lost momentum and became tedious. Its lack of depth is another reason why the central message might be lost on some viewers. I, with my goofy goober ass, was the only male family member who watched this film. 

Feminism didn't triumph with Barbie. The movie was too shallow to change opinions about feminism or gain many new adherents to the movement. The only real winners from this film are Mattel and the people who worked on the movie. Even with all that said, this is still probably one of the better feminist-themed movies I've seen in recent times. 

Barbie failed to accurately depict women's issues, instead presenting a cartoon-like version of reality with no real substance. This approach doesn't educate anyone who watches the movie. Most viewers already know that women can be sexually harassed, so this film would likely be an ineffective tool for teaching about that serious subject. The movie's treatment of women's issues feels constrained and bare-bones, resulting in a dull and unengaging portrayal. Surprisingly, Ken was the best part of this movie, even though it's titled 'Barbie.' He seemed to carry the film single-handedly, which underscores the film's shortcomings in handling its central themes.",2023-08-14 04:23:07,1,TrueFilm,moist_yoda,comment,Is the message of Barbie (2023) going over everyone‚Äôs heads?

This is how most men need to feel every day. They can never show feelings or weakness and if you do no one cares about it. Even though we are being portrayed as bad guys in the world of now. This is never how it was for men. Most of us are simple and like simple things to be loved and to have someone that we can take care of. Not to be the boss of. It is a shame that that is what this has all ended up as.

35,"It is going over some people's heads. Barbieland is supposed to be a place where the Barbies reign as a reflection of the *toy*. Barbie's can be anything and are perfect. The Kens have no job except beach because the *toy* has no real purpose other than to be an accessory to Barbie. Mattel never made a supreme court Ken so he's not there in Barbieland. Yea, you can say it's matriarchal reverse of the real world circa 1950s but those parallels aren't perfect to today because we've progressed from the 1950s and differently than what stereotypical Barbie thinks because real women, real *humans* are NOT perfect. Ferrara's speech is touching on the broader point of how nowadays women are now asked to be *perfect* and how Barbies have helped push that narrative. Rock an excellent career, take care of the home, and look hot.   


The main Ken, America Ferrara, and stereotypical Barbie at the end realize it's okay to have flaws, be themselves or be kenough, and gawddammit have cellulite! America Ferrara recognizes the cognitive dissonance and breaks through with ""yea, it's okay that I'm dark and scary and weird"". Ken is kenough and he doesn't need Barbie and he can like horses and beach and whatever else he finds about himself. And Barbie embraces change and not being perfect (growing old, dying, etc) in exchange for human dimension, depth, complexity. Because remember Barbieland is fake, plastic, and mostly unchanging. The people have one job, never age, and every day is the same. The real world is different in that everyone has a little bit of Ken, Barbie, weird Barbie, etc in them.   


Getting caught up on the specifics of males vs females and patriarchy vs matriarchy is so damn boring. Yea, we can talk about it in generalities but the main story is how being pigeonholed into certain roles/expectations is *dehumanizing for everyone* while using these toys as vehicle. We can also talk about capitalism but that one's way too meta and complicated.

Ken and Barbie are both written like they are dolls being played with by kids. Try rewatching the movie this way and everything will seem totally different!   


The way they deliver their lines, the way characters process emotions and are learning about themselves and the world.¬†  


They‚Äôre supposed to be little kids acting like adults as they play a game (like you do when you play with Barbies), and learning along the way.

  
There‚Äôs even a little sarcasm there, making fun of how silly little kids can be. Ken acts SO silly because he‚Äôs supposed to be Ken being played with by a little boy (like by a friend‚Äôs little brother).¬†  
The meaning of the whole movie changed for me when I realized this, because it's not just about feminism, it‚Äôs about growing up. It‚Äôs about learning who you are and how you fit into society, how your game is different from reality, and it‚Äôs about learning about feminism and the patriarchy and processing what it means and what to do about it‚Ä¶ all it in your imaginary play world.  
It‚Äôs also very much about how that little kid is still inside of all of us, and about how most of us are still growing up too.¬†Ken is a little kid who is learning what it means to be a ‚Äúman.‚Äù And Barbie is learning what it is to be a ‚Äúwoman.‚Äù ¬†And they both learn that being authentically who you are is much more complicated. And they learn it like little kids learning through play.¬†  
And yeah, the¬†movie is making fun of Ken/men, but they‚Äôre MORE making fun of the ‚Äúannoying friend‚Äôs little brother‚Äù inside so many grown men and how often that little boy is running the show.¬†  
And if you ever had a friend's little brother who had a crush on you, Ken is 10000% what it is like to play with that little kid. His feelings are all over the map and he messes up your Barbie‚Äôs house and he wants to change the game but you all end up learning and processing a little something about the real world through play.¬†  
And the same with the Mom in the movie. She‚Äôs having a crisis and feels vulnerable and sad and got out her old Barbies because she‚Äôs feeling a lot of big new things and that‚Äôs how she‚Äôd process her feelings when she was a kid and when she played with her daughter (like so many of us do) and she just missed that time in her life.¬†

Masculinity/patriarchy/capitalism view things in in a very binary sense, whereas real feminism/matriarchy views things more in a grey sense.

""Tonight I saw Barbie.

I think people are going to be watching this movie, talking about it, finding inspiration in it, arguing about it, loving it, hating it, thinking about it, studying it, and in some way engaged by it, for decades to come. It is possibly the most existentialist-themed film to come out of Hollywood in a long while.

Yes, it‚Äôs a feminist film too. That much is obvious going in. The ‚ÄúIt is literally impossible to be a woman‚Äù speech needed to be there, even if it‚Äôs not an especially new message‚Äî some variation of it has crossed my social media stream almost every day for many years. 

I get that that message needs to continue to be said until the people who need to get it finally get it.

But I think the existentialist theme is the more interesting one. At the beginning of the film, Barbie is an object. She‚Äôs so perfect, that she isn‚Äôt even interesting. She lives in herself, but not *for* herself. And Ken is an object, too: in fact he wants to be an object, for as the narrator tells us he feels entirely unfulfilled unless Barbie is looking at him. He lives neither in himself nor for himself. So far, Barbie-land is fine, if a little weird. And then, Barbie drops the existential question: ‚ÄúAny of you guys ever think about dying?‚Äù

At that point, I felt able to settle into my seat in the cinema and enjoy myself, able to ignore that I was the only guy in the cinema who had gone to see it alone. Don‚Äôt believe me? I‚Äôll photograph my ticket for you. But then, wouldn‚Äôt that be a Ken-ish thing to do? That is, to need to be seen as something, and to feel that need so deeply as to feel empty and angsty without it?

(Whoa, I think I just had an out-of-movie experience.)

I love that Barbie‚Äôs quest is a quest for realisation, a quest for the real. I love that Barbieland is Plato‚Äôs Cave. That the real world is messy, complicated, and a little dangerous. That Ken craves Barbie‚Äôs gaze so deeply, he organizes a patriarchal takeover of Barbieland in order to get it‚Äî and then he doesn‚Äôt get it, because he finds himself neck deep in a Hegelian master-servant dialectic. I love that Weird Barbie is a shaman. That Allan sees both early-film Barbieland, and the Ken kingdom, for the dead ends that they are. I love that Barbie accidentally finds herself on a quest for God‚Äî that is, Ruth Handler, her creator. And most of all, I love that Barbie decides what she wants is ‚Äúto be part of the people that make meaning, not the thing that is made.‚Äù

That‚Äôs what I want too, Barbie. That‚Äôs why studied philosophy.

In fact I love something else about this film more than that. I love that all over this planet, millions and millions of girls are going to watch this film, thinking that they‚Äôre in for a semi-escapist, feminist-themed, family comedy film, about nothing more consequential than a toy. And on one level they‚Äôre going to get that film. But they‚Äôre *also* going to get an introduction to several of the most important and influential ideas in existentialism and phenomenology. They‚Äôre going to learn about the patriarchy. And Plato‚Äôs Cave. And Sartre and de Beauvoir‚Äôs Le Regard, and Le Regard Masculaine. And Hegel‚Äôs Dialectic. And the social construction of identity. And Hume‚Äôs Bundle Theory. And Heidegger‚Äôs being-towards-death. And Brechtian meta-theatricality. They‚Äôll even get a touch of Marxism‚Äî but not too much, as Barbie is still a corporate IP, and the film is full of product placements. They‚Äôll see an homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey. And Pinnochio. And the goddess Innana. And they‚Äôll get a demonstration from Barbie, Ken, and Gloria, of what speaking from the heart, and from a place of pain, can look like, and how it can be healing. 

And on most of these themes, the film doesn‚Äôt just ‚Äúask the question‚Äù. It takes a stand. It picks a side. It builds the argument. And it‚Äôs too busy dancing to care if you disagree.

I hope that a generation of boys will watch this film, and see how absolutely ridiculous Ken looks when he‚Äôs running his Ken kingdom. (Aside: in that phase of his story, he looked, moved, and spoke like all the bullies who made my life miserable in primary school and high school.) I hope that in watching this film, they‚Äôll see there are ways to be a man that don‚Äôt involve perpetuating the patriarchy. And it‚Äôs up to us to find them. Although I worry that some of those boys watching this film will grasp that self-aware Barbie, living both in herself and for herself, doesn‚Äôt need Ken. And then they, too, might throw a patriarchal temper tantrum, as Ken did for a while. Perhaps they‚Äôll tape a Bible to a baseball bat, and trash a Barbie dollhouse with it?

Oh, I see. That happened. Oh dear.

Incidently, I was not the only Ken in the cinema tonight. But all the others who I could see, were there with their kids, and they looked like they were fulfilling a family duty and very uncomfortable doing it. One of them was in a hurry to leave, when the credits rolled. But credit to them, for showing up anyway, for their kid‚Äôs sake if not for their own.

As for me, I‚Äôm glad I saw this film. And I‚Äôm glad I saw it in a cinema. I think that I have work to do, now. People with whom to relate to better. And meaning to create. Also, questions to ask, concerning what it means to create meaning.

All right, those are my off-the-cuff thoughts for tonight. Let me know what you think, too. And if any of you know someone in the cast and crew, thank them for me, please.""",2023-08-24 23:22:15,1,TrueFilm,CuriousIzUz,comment,Is the message of Barbie (2023) going over everyone‚Äôs heads?

41,"I think the message of the movie should have focused on the complexities of human life, not just what women and men deal with separately.

The movie is entirely too vague on what should be a ""good thing"" and a ""bad thing."" Barbieland's matriarchy is as corrupt and evil as 1900s and earlier patriarchy, yet is completely celebrated and is considered the driving good behind Barbieland. And yet left-wing viewers see this as a direct correlation to today's patriarchy (which factually is nonexistant), and point at it and say ""see? Women have no power today! Feel bad, men!"" At the end, the quote ""One day the Kens will have as much power as women do in the real world."" is almost purposefully misinterpreted by most left-wing viewers, as they assume this means women have no power in the real world like the Kens do having one executive seat.

For America's character, her speech about womanhood is almost word-for-word easily translated to men, and the general human experience. And yet it seemingly is only about being a women, essentially declaring that men have no issues whatsoever when exploring the complexities of the world.

Its sickening how much human hardship is forced down our throats as exclusively womens' issues.

43,"The part I didn‚Äôt agree with the most was not having Barbie‚Äôs younger siblings like Kelly. Barbie was important to me because even though she has a career she always had a motherly love for her sister. Even in the earlier Barbie movies she is seen helping her sisters and mentoring them while having her own life. That was important to me since my mom stayed home with me and then later went back to work I saw through my mom and Barbie that you didn‚Äôt have to give up on your careers and dream to be a mom or a good sister. Likewise Barbie and my mom showed me that being responsible for someone or being an important part of someone else‚Äôs life, like a baby or sister, is not something that should be seen as annoying or a speed bump. That having a family doesn‚Äôt stop you from your dreams, but encourages you to work harder and be a source of purpose. Barbie in the movies always went out of her way to live on her sisters, even if she was with her friends or getting hope from work. She prioritized her family and they encouraged her to follow her dreams. I think they really missed out on the motherly/sisterly loving nature Barbie has. That wanting to be feminine doesn‚Äôt always mean being a mom or wanting to have a care means not being feminine. I think they totally conveniently ignored that fact. That Barbie knows how to care for others and be selfless to people she loved.

In the name of 'feminisim' which in this day and age in most developed countries, much like 'anti racism' movements the goal of these people is not to have equality but rather to be treated superior and to extract 'revenge' for wrongs of the past I just see a shitton of sexism against men. Like, I have only ever dated assholes and have been both used and abused by men pretty much my whole life and I still feel BAD for them when I see how horrible and sexist and entitled women are these days. I don't think Barbie is trying to show how men treat women in IRL but it is very accurate of how women treat men in 2023. With hatred. What women want in 2023 is to extract revenge, make men suffer and act like they don't need men, but still want to use them to provide for them, mostly financially.

51,"You seem like a practical thinker and I agree with most of your analysis of the film, though I must say that a key reality based factor is somehow omitted from the entire gender conversation. Making babies and the motherly role of parenting are the single largest impact on the career path and societal standing in a woman's life should she choose to reproduce.  The movie does seem to address some of the issues in a society with gender roles, from a woman's perspective, however fails to represent one of the first and most roles that a woman in society has. This may seem like a misogynistic statement however I would like to remind you that as primates, and a society, we would cease to exist without a population. Hence there is no discussion of society and culture without population. It's also worth mentioning that population decline is currently the biggest threat to most of the major world economies, including the US, in modern times. Is it a coincidence this runs parallel to a time in history when these ""gender role conversations"" surrounding feminism and women in the workplace are being had? Perhaps... perhaps not. Maybe there's something there.

Reproduction is societies most important role in propagating it's values. Furthermore, the population goes into moral decline when the role of parenting is not provided throughout upbringing by a man or woman though this role is biologically linked to women. This is not only due to them carrying the child, producing milk, and having a cocktail of hormones that aid in nurturing but men are also handicapped in nurturing due to the higher levels of testosterone. I can speak to this personally being that I raised my child alone, without a woman around, from infancy and frustration was something I fought internally on a constant basis. Testosterone is great for protecting and fighting, a key role, but horrible for patience and nurturing.

There are reasons why nature and nurture have created societies built by men and many of them are physiological and biological. I am not speaking in opinions, rather facts. I believe this is where the complex conversation of the specific confusion of Western American cultures confusion seems to be stemming as of late. The movie fails to bring the slightest bit of light to these physiological and biological realities which is very suspect with regards to it's motives and the validity of it's narratives.

Now... For an original thought and take. I personally feel that women are enjoying a period of empowerment where some, much needed, social and gender adjustments are taking place. Harassment, glass ceilings, and a lot more issues are among some of the overdue conversations that are being tied up and put aside. These conversation have been had for some time but real change has taken place. Side note, perhaps women will grow to accept a man who can cry and talk about his feelings as well rather than be offput by it. Neither gender seems comfortable or ready to see a man who doubts his confidence, or rather admits it since all men as people will doubt themself occasionally. There are gender problems on both sides yet misandry is a word most people don't even know since men are shamed for being victims by both fellow men and women alike.

Additionally men are raised knowing they have power and are taught that true power is knowing your strength and being able to hold back or opt out of implementing. This is a gender culture based lesson that women aren't raised with. A man is tought from childhood that in most situations you never hit a women, or even fight a man much smaller than you and even if you must to practice restraint. True power isn't being able to be a CEO it's knowing that you can be if you wanted to and choosing something else that feels true. Having something to prove scantly looks good regardless of gender. In order to be in a position of power you must be trained to be a magnanimous leader early on. 99.9% of men never rise to truly significant positions of power so this supersedes a purely gender conversation though it is a part of it. This is why in all those movies about medieval times the kings were raised to be such since childhood. The lessons were always about being a just and kind leader who knows how to not make the first move of power just because you can.

Power is to be wielded with great responsibility, not waived around and used just because it can be. This lesson needs to be taught as a part of the conversation to young women who are told they are just as eligible to be future leaders as anyone else. These days people are shamed for saying they want to raise a family and support the entire home climate for that family which includes the entire foundation of her man. I understand this is a paradigm of man/woman traditional mainstream relationship but I am aiming to have a broader and general conversation here about the overwhelming majority. If we truly want more female leaders we need to start being harder on younger girls the way we are on younger boys in order to raise seriously responsible people. This is something I'm not sure society is ready to do, nor do I think we are programmed to be hard on smaller young girls out of a chemical response to the nurturing female gender and smaller kids. Even till today, there isn't a country in the world that in hostage situation doesn't say ""women and children"" to be released first. This is currently happening right now in Israel as Hamas still holds israeli hostages from the 10/7/23 massacre and hostage taking in Israel. Women even before children because of their value in being able to produce more. This value is seen as the highest societal value and always has. Women have always been the most valuable societal component. Look at a chess board, the king moves one space at a time but the Queen has free reign and most movement. The queen is the best piece and she protects the fairly handicapped King. This isn't something anyone complains about ever.  This is no simple topic and yet a Barbie movie like discussion of it is about as deep as we ever go without even discussing things like childbirth. Lets not look to the Barbie movie for a real conversation and hold it accountable for furthering a lot of issues with this... I shudder to use to word ""conversation"" as it's more a rant of female empowerment and victimization. But... with great power comes greater restraint.

I recall attending Binghamton University in 2002 and taking a gender studies class thinking we would be studying gender studies. After seeing a lecture hall filled with almost all women, and flipping through the textbook, I realized that the class was in fact a feminism class that was called gender studies. There wasn't a shred of self awareness surrounding this. I think that summed it up and that was over 20 years ago. There never seems to have been an interest in gender studies, female empowerment... but, with great power comes the need for greater restraint. Any chef knows that every single recipe, even the sweet ones, need salt for balance. We can't talk about women without talking about men. With regards to female empowerment, restraint is something I've seen little mention of in the relationship/reproductive/gender issues as of today.",2023-12-22 16:20:52,1,TrueFilm,Unusual_Scientist_38,comment,Is the message of Barbie (2023) going over everyone‚Äôs heads?

52,"Finally saw this movie. Speaking as a millennial woman here btw. I think the issue isn't that the message went over my head, just that it was somewhat unearned and condescending.  

When I try to identify the difference between what I consider ""woke"" storytelling vs healthier forms of progressive/inclusive storytelling, the key distinction I identify is that healthy progressive/inclusive storytelling is about dismantling societal power dynamics while ""woke"" storytelling is about subverting/reversing societal power dynamics.  The latter is actually counterintuitive to progressivism because it essentially blames the players and not the game.   


 While I do understand that the final message of Barbie was indeed about dismantling power games between genders, it was a rushed message towards the very end of the movie while the vast majority of the runtime still came off as relying very heavily into the idea that women should be assumed to have a distinct set of struggles while men should be assumed to be associated with a distinct set of toxic masculine ideals.  

Both the mother and daughter characters have respective scenes where they preach about the injustices society commits upon women, yet we never see either of these characters genuinely experiencing the issues that they are venting about.   Ken poisons Barbieland with a bunch of very distinct toxic masculine/sexist tropes, yet the movie implies that he has acquired knowledge of these tropes through a very brief and vague encounter with the idea of patriarchy.    


Idk, all in all it just seems like the movie is trying to tell one message (about breaking down gender roles) while at the same time very much playing into the idea that certain gender stereotypes/tropes are indeed accurate.    


like its 2023 and much of the messaging about feminism just isn't really relevant anymore.  Seeing Barbie wearing flat comfortable shoes at the end as a sign of liberation was kind of an eye roll for me.

54,"I'll tell you what I believe. I believe her going to a gynecologist was to show women have the ultimate power of reproduction, which is true. Other than the ending the movie was a farce and polarizing. The section where someone said they couldn't get a medal was laughable. The only medals that matter to me are the ones where people risk their lives in wartime in life-and-death scenarios. You want to win a medal, then go fly to Ukraine, rush a trench, and survive. Watch Saving Private Ryan and tell me those people didn't deserve a medal. I'll tell you the reality. If a woman today joined the military, rushed a trench, took out a tank, and saved a platoon, they wouldn't only be earning medals, she would be famous and get more recognition than a man who did the same thing. She would be headline news.

Barbie is so off point I would never take my kids to see it. For those people who said they had to see it twice to understand it, do you think an 8-year-old will be able to understand the deeper meanings? So your 8-year-old boy will walk out of the movie and say, I guess I shouldn't be competitive that they shouldn't help women that ask them for help? Do you think a man like Ken (Ryan Gosling) would get jealous of Barbie because she showed interest in another man? Men who are in the top 1% wouldn't give a damn, they would say ""Bye, you want to talk to someone else go ahead, I'll get someone else."" The men who would get jealous are either really in love or desperate. So let's manipulate the men that love us or the desperate guy, which none of those guys were.


So what message is this exactly saying to an 8-year-old girl? Yes, they have a few lines that try to show fairness, but it's a farce. The vast majority were showing how to manipulate men to defeat them instead of having a real dialogue with them. The arc was that the so-called ""patriarchy"", which was the same as Barbieland where men had no voice, could be defeated by manipulating men. The movie shows 8-year-old girls, that being blonde and having blue eyes is beautiful since she is the main character. That looks are uber important since she had cellulite that detracted from her beauty. These were blatantly at the forefront while the innuendo and supposed ""deeper"" levels have to be explored which requires a few watchings. Yeah, I'll make sure to have my 8-year-old daughter write me a report. The entire idiocy of ""mansplaining?"" versus someone who just likes to talk about things interesting to them, which is the VAST majority of the time and to be helpful. Guess what, men explain things to men too, especially if they are interested in that topic. If a guy explains something to a guy who already knows about it, the guy let's it be known. It's called communication. 

This is the reality, women control what men do in the U.S. If women dated men who didn't follow the idea of the so-called ""patriarchy"", give it a decade and men will change. When women start dating the awkward guy who shares his feelings with everyone vs. the strong, ""alpha"" football player, men will change. When women decide they'd rather date the guy who wants to be a stay-at-home father than a manager of a company who ""competes"", is ambitious, and makes a lot of money allowing their spouse to stay home, then men will change. 

If you're that rare unicorn who is a beautiful young lady who seriously wants a husband who will take care of the kids at home, you'll have a line out the door. Unfortunately, those men who line up will all of a sudden be unattractive to the majority of women because they want someone equal to or better than them in earning potential, ambitious, and competitive. For those men out there, if you find that lady who loves you and doesn't care if you make less than them and doesn't look down on you for showing emotional weakness, hold on to them tight.",2024-01-25 07:36:13,1,TrueFilm,Mindless-Medium-2441,comment,Is the message of Barbie (2023) going over everyone‚Äôs heads?

In my view the movie makes a rather valid argument against patriarchy, but at the same time promotes matriarchy. The problem is that modern feminism has completely warped the values of what feminism originally was. Feminism was about equality. Today, feminism is all about portraying women as victims, and yet, at the same time promoting the idea that women are superior to men. I think the movie fails to highlight the importance of equality and chooses instead to slyly promote matriarchy, as evident by the end of the film, where the Barbies reclaim power and still treat the Kens like idiots who deserve nothing.  
Even if your argument is correct, it still paints men in a negative light by offering an oversimplistic view of them much aligned with modern feminist perception. I think the movie had a chance to show that equality is what's important, but blew it with that ending.

The fact that there exists a joke for Ben Shapiro and all the haters  proves their point, imo.

Yes, ALL Kens are accessories to ALL Barbies.  Did you just claim the opposite is true in real life?  You cannot be more disingenuous when you claim ALL women are accessories to ALL men.  I think you might be so narrow minded to only see the top 0.0000001% of men who are also part of the ""oligarchy"".  This shows how ignorant most feminists are when it comes to common sense.

70,"I agree with the reversal role of Barbieworld being a representation of real life as patriarchy. However I do feel like the feminism portrayed in the film was classic millennial girl boss capitalist feminism (which as much as I love and respect Greta Gerwig feels a bit 2010s). The film obviously anticipated the Internet critique that would ensue after so it tried to keep up through constant commentary and jokes. I found the commentary a little off putting and overwhelming as I felt like I couldn't relax and watch the film without someone talking about the patriarchy constantly (it felt like some sort of pseudo YouTube cultural critique as a movie/advertisement). 

Some of the jokes were genuinely funny and self aware such as the discontinuation of the pregnant barbie, the weird outcast barbie who does the splits or the Kens playing the matchbox 20 song. But other jokes like Sasha calling barbie fascist and the foot flatten joke or even the last line about going to the gynocologist felt overplayed. Like I felt like they were doing the laughing for me and overselling the joke a bit (like when they all gag and yell at barbies flat feet it was really over the top and I cringed but maybe that was intended idk?). It did feel targeted in many ways towards millennial humour in general so perhaps that's why.  That isn't to say that the film didn't have funny moments, I also believe that since the trailer was so popular before there were bite size clips that once you saw them in the movie were not interesting at all. 

Its pretty clear that Mattel is trying to rebrand itself and it just a big advertisement (I don't think this is some hard to see esoteric point btw its just pretty clear since I hear pretty vague public announcements about them doing more toy movies in Hollywood?). Its the classic reinventing self-aware rebranding bs that marketers try to do. 

I low-key hated the message that women are girl bosses who are powerful and can do anything (even if it was ironic or satirical on some level), especially at the end when it portrayed like the classic ""women are busy writing the constitution while men fight their petty wars"" seemed to reemploy the patriarchal idea that women are too empathetic and gentle in nature to be capable of war or aggressive behaviour while men are naturally the opposite. My reading of this could easily be wrong though. In any case I still enjoyed the film and already feel I put way too much thought into pulling it apart.",2023-08-11 13:24:03,1,TrueFilm,SouthBee8705,comment,Is the message of Barbie (2023) going over everyone‚Äôs heads?

71,"The movie wants to pose as super clever and ironic about gender and relations between the genders. But yet 2 key issues seem to be missed by most commenters.

1. Doesn't it bother most of you that the way women ""get their way"" back to power is not by persuasion or building a good argument but by a) Deceit- they flatter and deceive men, b) fostering acrimony  (the whole scheme is to get men to fight amongst themselves) and c) dis enfranchising voters by deceit?  If I didn't know any better Barbies concept of empowering women is indistinguishable from the worst medieval arguments against women holding any kind of civic power (women are full of deceit and schemes to ruin men).
2. At the end of the movie, Barbie becomes a ""real"" woman not by embracing her sensibility, emotional insights, tolerance, etc., but by getting a Vagina. I guess that sets back the recent gender debate squarely into the biological sex=gender, despite the posture of hiring trans actors to depict women.",2023-08-02 17:57:15,1,TrueFilm,uselessposter22,comment,Is the message of Barbie (2023) going over everyone‚Äôs heads?

Our relationship is very equal though and so are those of my friends/peers. The company I work for has a very female 'heavy' senior leadership team and so have many others I've worked for. Maybe the UK is more progressive than the US where this is based? I've seen many arguments for and against this movie now, but what confuses me most is that Mattel misrepresents itself with it's own board being relatively equal in terms of a male/female split - why pretend that it's made up entirely of men?

And especially to the other gender. Boys don't easily relate to girls either, it goes both ways.

At the same time, girls products have been very ""suggestive"" in many different ways since always. This Barbie movie isn't going any further than the average girl-oriented bands, apps, magazines, TV shows, etc... There is simply more money thrown at it, and they also revised the traditional idea we had about barbies. Maybe. Because I don't have the first clue about them, to be honest.

Anyway, this isn't very different than the Little Mermaids debate.

My husband, who watched with me, drove that home for me when we were discussing the movie afterwards.  He said guys are kind of the opposite of that.  They think they're better than they actually are, where women tend to pick ourselves apart over every little thing.  Sticking with the ""role reversal"" theme, women need to release themselves of attachments to find their own way, as Barbie told Ken he was free to be something more than just her accessory.

83,"I don't understand why women can be whatever they want but men can't be ""manly"", at least to a large extent. Which (being virile), paradoxically, women really like and which we are often forced to be for them.

In other words: in my opinion, the weak point of modern feminism is that it blames almost only men, not seeing women's shortcomings and not understanding the real problems of men. What scares me is that women are less and less empathic with men, due to rampant misandry, and fail to appreciate the efforts men make for them, including self-analysis and fighting for their rights. They always see the worst part of men, whose causes are complex and which already hurt us, but instead of helping us they treat us even more badly and coldly.Then they will say that men do not get affection, etc. Yes, indeed, don't you realize that you are promoting the ugly part of our gender role, by continuing to be cold to us, and by continuing to say that we shouldn't complain about what we feel we are experiencing.

You seem to want to make our life even more lonely and cold.

Actually many men adore women and if they are wrong with them it is not on purpose and they are trying to get better. But women are only struggling with gender stereotypes that offend them, not those that offend men. This is why the others and I feel more alone and misunderstood than before.

Barbie may be a good movie but it doesn't help men because it fits the pattern I was saying. She seems to shit on men mostly, seems to dictate how we should be and wants us to shut up if we feel hurt.

then, I don't know with what courage, he will tell us that we have to be ourselves and cry if we want to. No woman in real life has been happy for me to cry or talk about my problems. They all wanted the manly man and the more I behaved according to the patriarchy, the more I gained female favor.

All this made me sad.

I hope that sooner or later women will want to look inward with good self-criticism and take care of men's problems as we are doing with them.

I learned to be dumb and manly from girls, not from my parents or professors. so I understood the true complexity of patriarchy, what it means that it's hard not to be what the stereotype wants. You don't heal with a sermon, you heal with a collective effort, because when the sermon is over and you go out there everybody's used to being a certain way. Not only men, but also women.

And men don't have a movement and scientific studies to help them, nor are women used to understanding their problems because feminism doesn't deal with them or very few do, to date.

I think it's because of all these things that men aren't happy that, once again, they are being held up and portrayed as stupid monsters. As if eviscerated trolls and goblins weren't enough (where are the uruk-hai woman?), women too now have to lay down their burdens in their own way.

In fact, that approach would have probably been more effective. I will say, the smartest observation the movie had was when the Kens talked about how being in charge of everything actually kind of sucked and being the president, or CEO, or supreme court justice, or whatever didn't actually make them happy. 

Ironically, the Kens ended up being the funniest and most interesting characters because they were just vapid himbos and were heavily flawed characters. The Barbies were unfortunately kind of boring, which I think is a big miss in a Barbie movie.",2023-07-26 06:52:09,-1,TrueFilm,RaindropDripDropTop,comment,Is the message of Barbie (2023) going over everyone‚Äôs heads?

104,"I think the people criticizing the movie for misandry and the people who feel offended by those criticisms just prove that most people now a days watch/read/listen only to find them self confirmed :)

First of all it‚Äôs a silly, somewhat fun movie that is in it self not that consistent and not as deep as people want to believe and that‚Äôs totally fine, it‚Äôs a movie about Barbie and a vehicle for Mattel to push the brand. 

All the misery we are told are so female specific are of course universal - its the human condition, we all suffer, doubt ourself, feel overwhelmed etc. doesn‚Äôt matter what gender. I think that‚Äôs a missed opportunity - to bring the genders together. Wouldn‚Äôt it have been nice if Mattel at the end produces similar toy equipment for Ken and promote ‚Äúgirls and boys play together - if they want!‚Äù ?

What we saw instead are women/dolls who fall back to the very clich√© female strategy to overcome clich√© men‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs pretty lame and can hurt men, especially because the crowd jumps up and down after the movie and talks again about toxic masculinity and patriarchy as the root of all evil - what is of course naive and doesn‚Äôt do any good to women or men and also ignores how complex we are as beings‚Ä¶.

105,">The irony of the entire movie is that Barbies treat the Kens the way men treat women in the real world - Barbie IS the patriarchy. Barbies hold all positions of power in Barbieland and are the only ones represented in roles such as doctors, pilots, etc. Ken is only good for beach and looking good, nothing else. The Kens are merely accessories to Barbie, they are the arm candy to these powerful and self-sufficient women. Ken is only happy when he is with Barbie, he is nothing without Barbie. Sound familiar?

No, because nothing like this has existed in the real world in like 50 years. And every single movie in the last 50 years has repeatedly pounded into our heads that such a patriarchal driven world is evil. If Ben Shapiro is calling this man-hating, then he's correct.",2023-07-25 16:50:18,-2,TrueFilm,adrift98,comment,Is the message of Barbie (2023) going over everyone‚Äôs heads? Let‚Äôs discuss
106,"One of my favorite complaints about the movie is around the use of the word patriarchy. I see people explaining how this is men hating because they speak of it like it‚Äôs a bad thing etc. etc. I find that these people are telling on themselves (of course they are because they‚Äôre complaining about the Barbie movie) in an interesting way. America, (I live there so most of the complaints about it I see are people from America) is NOT a patriarchy, it‚Äôs a republic. I know it doesn‚Äôt seem that way if you were to look at the entire history of our leadership but it‚Äôs true. So when people complain about Barbie for this reason I feel like they really believe that we live in a patriarchy, openly, and that everyone knows and should respect that. The movie actually touches on it nicely when Ken is speaking to that executive and notes something like ‚Äòit still is we just hide it better.‚Äô",2023-07-25 16:50:54,-3,TrueFilm,colesm13,comment,Is the message of Barbie (2023) going over everyone‚Äôs heads?

But they point out the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Barbie girl‚Äù song that is somehow in this post used as an example of how innocent and child like the marketing is. Does she find that song appropriate for her daughter to listen to? You ever listen to how adult that song is? 

I don‚Äôt have the same hang ups this person has about this stuff and if I had a child I would be happy to show them the Barbie movie and let them listen to the music. 

As this person pointed out, trying to shield your child from the world doesn‚Äôt work and other kids will teach your child If you don‚Äôt. I would rather my child get educated by me and let me be in charge of how they receive the information than learn it from other kids who learned it from other kids, who learned it from really unreliable or dangerous sources? When you watch the movie, instead of removing the child and trying to keep them in a box, maybe make note of some of the content you felt was too adult and talk to them about it after the movie. Most of that stuff probably went over their head and they had no idea it even happened. But if they did, ask them what they thought. ‚ÄúWhat did you think about the relationship between Ken and Barbie?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy do you think he wanted to have a sleepover?‚Äù ‚ÄúWasnt it weird how that man was talking to Barbie? Did you think it was okay how he was talking to her? Why or why not? How should he have talked to her? If someone were to talk to you that way, what would you do?‚Äù Obviously depending on your child‚Äôs age. Also, no other movies overly broadcast that they are Pg 13. It is your job as the parent to pay attention to those ratings. That‚Äôs why they exist. The teens at the movie theatre don‚Äôt care and probably assume that you decided it was worth taking your kids to.

Also, movie would not be empty without little kids, everyone I know is going to see it and we are all adults without children lol.

My youngest found the costumes and weird Barbie the funniest.

They didn't ask questions about the sexual connotations. When they did quote the ""beach-off"" moment, I asked what would a beach-off involve. They suggested surfing and building sand castles. I said that sounded right.

There were other parents and children there, and none of them were crying.

346,"My response to the letter: 

Hello Ms. Parmar,

We regret to inform you that Barbie is not now and has never been a real person. The kids who have played with her and the other dolls in this product line over the decades have all had a different conception of Barbie. Unsurprisingly, the Barbie of their conception very much reflected their beliefs and aspirations; such is the nature of childhood imagination and play. All have had to accept that this play was merely fantasy except, apparently, you. Again, we apologize for having to be the ones to break this news to you, and we hope you can understand why no one can be held responsible for your delusions about your childhood toys.

Sincerely,

Every other adult who once played with Barbies",2023-07-27 16:08:26,3,facepalm,OnMyThirdLife,comment,Is the Barbie movie really that inappropriate in its first 15 minutes?

Personally, I would much rather children be exposed to adult themes and sexuality than violence. Parents are supposed to talk to their kids and explain what they've seen, answer questions, and to not make a big deal about it because you don't want to confuse them or teach them that they're ""dirty"".

461,"Dear Barbie,  


I took my 14 year-old daughter and 8 year-old son to watch your film. I did research the fact that it was a ""PG-13"" movie and watched it myself before taking them, as I always do, because taking responsibility for which media your own kids consume is kind of the deal with parenting. Nothing in the movie crossed the PG-13 guideline and I decided nothing in this movie was inappropriate for either of them; the only swear word was censored and they know that Barbie/Ken dolls don't have genitals, because they have both played with them and have eyes.

10 minutes into the movie, both my children were equal parts mesmerised and laughing their arses off. I don't think my son understood why Kate McKinnon wanted to see Ken's smooth blob, but he didn't care enough to ask, and if he \*had\* asked I wouldn't have minded answering because talking to your own kid isn't something sensible people struggle with. 

The film was great fun and I wasn't misled by your marketing at all, although the story surprised me. Kudos. I had a great time, my kids had a great time. My daughter was cheering at America Ferrara's speech and my son really wants the RC Barbie car for his birthday.

A happy parent,

It also covered the trans topic amazingly. ""He doesn't have a penis and I don't have a vagina"". ""That doesn't matter!""

587,"I saw Barbie opening day.


The words VAGINA AND PENIS are not inappropriate. They are natural body parts every human being has. 

What is inappropriate is the sexualization of those body parts, by white conservative mothers and fathers. There is nothing inherently wrong about our bodies. If you look at the BIBLE (you know the book with the stories about sky daddy and the like) it says that man and woman were created and were unclothed until woman ate the forbidden fruit, and they knew no shame for what they did as there was no wrong (talking about being unclothed).

Why is it so bad for a child to know the proper names of their body parts? I‚Äôd much rather my kids say, ‚Äú my vagina hurts‚Äù or, ‚Äúmy penis/ testicles hurt‚Äù then some made up cutsie name that muddies the water. 

For those that say it‚Äôs crass, which means lacking sensitivity, refinement, or intelligence‚Ä¶ you want me to be sensitive to your ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù but mine and my kids don‚Äôt matter? Or maybe its the lack refinement, like maybe a cutsie name a tutu would be more refined then the scientific name? And well we can‚Äôt say much about intelligence, except that dumbing down our vocabulary for our children serves no one, except those too afraid of their own bodies to even say their different parts proper names. Maybe I should go get the smelling salts?

Let‚Äôs be real honest here, Barbie is every girl and every boy that ever played with them. Because Barbie is the idea that a child can be whatever they dream. It‚Äôs awesome my daughter got to see BARBIE on the big screen take away the ‚Äúbadness‚Äù of the word vagina! That‚Äôs powerful. If Barbie can say vagina why can‚Äôt she? And that‚Äôs exactly why this movie was beautiful. Because it put the power back into the hands of those it was created for, the young dreamers. 

The movie explores the idea that a matriarchal society isn‚Äôt that far off the a patriarchal society, neither serves all it‚Äôs citizens, and to be a fully functional society there needs to be representation of all demographics.

654,"There‚Äôs a joke that hinges on a sexual innuendo being not understood by the characters repeating a phrase that sounds similar to a sexual term. 

If a kid is old enough to know the sexual term in question, they‚Äôll get it and laugh. If they don‚Äôt know the sexual term, they won‚Äôt suddenly learn it, they‚Äôll just miss a layer of the joke and think what‚Äôs funny is the surrounding context, which remains humorous without understanding of the innuendo aspect. They might possibly ask what‚Äôs so funny if they notice adults laughing more loudly than the amount of the joke they understand warrants. Up to you how much to explain at that point, it can probably be dismissed with a ‚Äúyou‚Äôll get it when you‚Äôre older‚Äù if you don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre old enough to know.

Sometimes parents forget that just because THEY understand an innuendo doesn‚Äôt mean a young child will also understand it. A lot just goes straight over a kid‚Äôs head (go rewatch a Disney cartoon as an adult sometime. The vast majority of them have some jokes kids won‚Äôt get to amuse the adults who have to supervise said kids).

It‚Äôs definitely nothing more inappropriate than you should generally expect to be in a film rated PG-13. It‚Äôs pretty tame for PG-13, honestly, but was clearly not made with children as the primary intended audience.

Someone screaming at the theater entrance that the move is pg-13 and has content inappropriate for children? I didn‚Äôt even realize it was rated that, but I don‚Äôt have kids and it doesn‚Äôt matter to me.

I‚Äôm tired of parents bitching about things they exposed their child to or things their child found because they weren‚Äôt monitoring their activities. I don‚Äôt have kids and I am tired of the ‚Äúwhat about the children?!‚Äù argument. I don‚Äôt like the idea of children being expo to something affecting what I see or do, like on YouTube. It‚Äôs been reduced to baby talk and stupid euphemisms all because of ad revenue and censorship for the kids. I was playing ff XIV and said something and someone said, ‚Äúshh there could be kids here.‚Äù And I‚Äôm like, I do not ever want to be  in a situation where I could accidentally end up interacting with kids online, ever, anywhere.  I know it‚Äôs not all on the parents and that it‚Äôs a hard job to do, but I just wish there was a separate internet for kids or something lol. I‚Äôm an adult and I don‚Äôt want any of what I say or do to be compromised just be a a kid could find it. I know this sounds selfish, but it is what it is I guess. I recognize it‚Äôs difficult to constantly watch over what your kid is doing, but, in this instance, I am being selfish, because I don‚Äôt care, it isn‚Äôt my problem. I don‚Äôt try to be offensive online and/or deliberately try to say or do things that would be bad for a kid to find, but I‚Äôd like to be able to watch things on YouTube covering serious and important subject matter without being infantilized with words like ‚Äúunalived‚Äù or all of the censorship either. 

Idk what the answer is to it all, but I wish they could figure out a better system. It‚Äôs bad enough with the almost constant paranoia about pedophiles and such. I‚Äôm just bitching really. I‚Äôm down with protecting children, but only in as far as it doesn‚Äôt negatively affect my experiences. Some compromise is acceptable, but only after parental due diligence. 

I realize my stance will probably offend people, but if kids weren‚Äôt used a shield for hatred so often I probably wouldn‚Äôt feel this way. I‚Äôm an adult, gay, man, so forgive me here, it‚Äôs just that they‚Äôve tried to weaponize children against me and my community for a very long time and I‚Äôm sick of it. It absolutely informs how I feel about all of this as well. It‚Äôs just people conveniently use kids as a way to cover up their own hatred and bigotry constantly.

I didn't tend to watch a lot of the adult cartoons when I was a kid. They didn't appeal to me. But I did watch things that had implied sex scenes ""under the sheets"" and had serious complex topics like Dances with Wolves was a particular favorite  of mine.

 It's amazing how many parents think kids are going to be traumatized or so negatively affected by an innuendo or a curse word. Kids are crying because they are dragged out of a movie they are enjoying and have no idea it has anything to do with adult stuff.",2023-07-28 10:13:02,2,facepalm,PoiLethe,comment,Is the Barbie movie really that inappropriate in its first 15 minutes?

811,"The movies said ‚Äúpenis and vagina‚Äù one time I think.

Of course this isn‚Äôt for small children. 

I was honestly more surprised that this movie was as tame as it was. I fully expected there to be mentions of women‚Äôs healthcare and abortion and things like that. 

There was also one bleeped out F-bomb. 

But honestly this movie felt very tame, if not a tad obnoxious with its ‚Äúfeminist undertones‚Äù but still a decent movie by todays standards.

For me, a solid 7 out of 10.

824,"Yeah, i am sure indian girls' first exposure to and awareness of rape and the horrifyingly prevalent rape culture come from a movie...right?

No. One becomes cognizant of such things through the goddamn newspaper, with its detailed accounts of hideously violent rapes occuring every day all over the country.

It comes from living in a weirdly repressive society where sex is considered dirty, and a girl engaging in it, nay by simply being *not* averse to it, is considered perverted. 

Indian culture is really fucked up. There is no sex education, most girls aren't allowed boyfriends/a sex life, sex is considered a filthy thing. Boys are allowed so much (from swear words to teasing/harassing girls, drinking alcohol) and girls are allowed nothing or, in any case, less. Even in ""progressive"" families, girls have to fight for every bit of freedom...short clothes, boyfriends, being outside late at night, swearing like a french sailor and so on.

Instead of fighting against a movie which shows and accepts the things which exist in our world, maybe she should have spent some more energy trying to make indian society less sexist, less messed up, and more suitable for her daughter.

875,"first of all, Mattel is a massive corporation, and I'm absolutely positive they did market research before sinking 150 million into a film and collabing with all these brands to market both the film and the merch to adults. it literally exists as a means to advertise, there's loads of product placement both within the film and it's promotion. kids do not play with dolls like they used to, there's a reason it's Barbie rugs, electric toothbrushes, cosmetics, adult clothing and shoes and not a new line of dolls. secondly there is NOTHING inappropriate in this movie. growing up in the early 2000s we had much worse sexual innuendo on kids programming, and it went over our heads. a kids not going to notice but I think the most overtly sexual thing is Barbie being sexually harassed, and not understanding but feeling unsafe and uncomfortable and stating that she doesn't have genitals. 

even Ken's obsession with the patriarchy is pretty much only because he thought horses were much more involved and it made him feel important, which in barbie world he really never was. they're not meant to be a depiction of men and women, they're meant to be a depiction of plastic dolls and the way they interact with the world around them is very childlike. 

I don't see any reason a child couldn't still enjoy the barbie movie, like yeah it's not FOR them. When I have kids I'm gonna be pretty adament about exposing them to good film and television and not relying on MPAA ratings for what is ok to expose then to. you can literally get the time stamps of anything that WON'T go over their head and simply distract them while you fast forward. some of the actual kids content out there is fucking disturbing and y'all just sitting your kids down in front of it like you don't need to moniter their screen time or pre-view/research media is wild.

948,"First,  it's clearly mom's fault 100% movies get ratings for a reason,  she chose to ignore the ratings, and expose her child to something she's too young for. Pg-13 doesn't mean it's for 13 and up. It means parental guidance is suggested for kids 13 and up, under 13 are discouraged even with parental guidance.

Second that movie is extremely tame compared to what 10 year Olds are exposed to every day at school, even worse in public schools, but private schools have it as well. That's just at school,  with social media, online games, and many other sources, it's literally impossible to keep your kids from being exposed to that level of inappropriate material. 

I'm not saying parents shouldn't try to allow their kids to enjoy their innocence and childhood before society forces them to grow up. I'm just saying it's a very steep uphill battle. Parents need to prepare themselves to have those kind of talks with their children. They are lying to themselves if they think they don't have to do so before high school.

So as a kid, I was in my best behavior because I did love going to the movies as a kid even if I wasn‚Äôt fond of the movie. The other option was to sit home bored. Because we were exposed to serious films, we were pretty much allowed to watch anything. Never shielded from watching anything. We were taught that movies were fantasy.

1007,"What I find to be particularly interesting is the complaints about shattering the perfect Barbie bubble..... Considering that is exactly one of the main things the movie is about. 

I found it to be a poignant realistic look at stereotypes from many different sides. 

I am also curious, how the original writer can feel comfortable saying in good faith there were no hints to the movie's nature in the previews, when in fact one of the reasons I decided to see it was a preview showing a clip in which Margot Robbie as Barbie asks in the middle of a dance party ""Do you guys ever think about dying?"" which causes the said dance party to come to an absolute halt. 

I was never a super girly girl, pink wasn't my thing, and I didn't grow up with the ""perfect blonde hair, blue eyes"" delusion. For me, playing with the dolls was about the imagination I could bring to them. I even had a few ""weird"" Barbies- born of my own desire to create and be part of something beautiful. 

There are plenty of young child friendly Barbie movies and other media out there. It's the writer's responsibility to do her research if she wishes to parent in a manner that shelters her child from the ideas presented in a form of media. I do appreciate that she owns that she did not pay attention to the PG13 rating. I doubt very much that anyone left crying because of the movie- if tears were shed it would be distinctly because of parents pulling their children out of the movie, and their displeasure at being denied something they were offered.

There are difficult themes to explain to a young child in the movie, yes, but on the grand scale of things, this movie is far from explicit. I saw it in a sold-out theater, and no one left the movie.

Sometimes, you just have to own that your choices as a parent don't line up with something and leave everyone else to enjoy it. You do not get to tell the rest of the world what they can enjoy because you choose not to partake in something.

1086,"Spoiler, if you have not seen the movie I am going to explain the first few minutes of it. The movie begins with an homage to 2001: a space oddessy, where girls in pinafores start by holding, caring, and feeding traditional baby dolls having a tea party. They then smash them, like taking a knife to the back of the patriarchy. There is a wink, from an enormous Barbie in the black and white swimsuit where she directly addresses the audience for the first of many times. This is not a movie for the under 10 crowd. If your child is still enthralled with Barbie‚Äôs, or doll playing in general, then this movie is too grown up for that child. If on the other hand, the child has started to cleave from being a young child to a preteen or teen, then the movie is fantastic. There are a ton of homages and Easter eggs in this movie. 

Yes, as a parent, you should look at common sense media or a movie ranking. This is not Barbie, life in the dream house (which is hilarious for adults and age appropriate for kids). This movie is really for the 18-50 year old woman who played with Barbie dolls as a child. It is a fantastic social commentary about life, expectations, reality, and how to have perspective on all of it. I cried many times during the movie. It hits so many emotional layers. But make no mistake, this is not a kids Barbie movie. If you are a fan of movies and life of the past 50 years then this movie is for you too. I will say, the tie ins before the movie was released were all for adults, not kids. So I really disagree with the letter writer.

1105,"Maybe the movie industry could come up with a rating system that would indicate more clearly what rating the movie has received, so parents can clearly see that a movie is rated, for example, PG-13. 

They‚Äôd look at the poster or trailer, and in the spot where it indicates the movie is PG-13, there will be a notice pointing out that there‚Äôs a rating visible elsewhere on the screen. Maybe saying ‚ÄúLook over here where the rating is‚Äù because maybe they‚Äôre not used to reading words and symbols in different parts of a screen or page. 

Or maybe in addition to the rating symbol, there‚Äôs a link or QR code where they can go to a website that has more information such as repeating the information that was on the trailer or poster. It could have all kinds of information like the title of the movie, the stars, the studio, director and so on. Like fine print but just duplicated for people who don‚Äôt like reading things on the original source.

Another idea: in this supplemental information they could include a bit more detail on the PG-13 rating, such as ‚ÄúSome material may be inappropriate for children under 13.‚Äù  It would help parents confused by the ambiguous acronym/number combination that has only been with us for 40 years now and would be quite unfamiliar with parents in their 60s or above who haven‚Äôt been to the movies since 1980 or so.",2023-07-27 16:10:47,2,facepalm,PaperbackBuddha,comment,Is the Barbie movie really that inappropriate in its first 15 minutes?

1270,"What a fucking insane person. I took my 7, 11, and 12 year old daughters and everyone loved it. There is a very powerful message about how unnecessary the patriarchy is and how capable women really are in the world. I can‚Äôt think of a more important lesson for my kids to learn. Sure there‚Äôs a few bad words and sexual references, but I promise you it‚Äôs better that what any 10, 11, or 12 year old girl hears on TV, music, and at school. Those things are just part of life and kids need to learn how to deal with them. My kids know these words exist but that they‚Äôre inappropriate and consequences will result if they ever use these words. It‚Äôs just not that complicated. Any 10 year old can grasp this concept. 

Also, I‚Äôm not a psychiatrist, but I think by stripping away some the mystery around these words you also strip away the allure of using them. 

Lastly, my 11 and 12 year old know what sex is. The 7 year old does not. And it‚Äôs as if the 7 year old watched a completely different movie than the 11 and 12 year old. She didn‚Äôt get any of the sexual references, and so she really wasn‚Äôt exposed to anything.

During the ""beach off"" scene, the adults giggled and the kids told their dad to stop laughing because it ""wasnt that funny"" lmao. 
When Ken and Barbie go to the real world and say they dont have a penis or vagina the kids went ""how do they pee, daddy?"" lol The dad was constantly telling them to be quiet.
Finally, President Barbie says a no-no word. Its bleeped out. The kids gasped and ask their dad if Barbie will be in time out LMAO
Honestly i believe the movie is mostly pg-13 because kids wont understand the undertones and wont get the message.

It's always these parents trying to blame the movie and not themselves for not looking up the rating

Barbie was definitely targeted for an older audience, but not sexually per se. It dealt with social commentary on sexism but made it into an analogy with Barbie land

That's the only real ""older"" type of subject matter I saw.

It's not something I think a person young than eight would really grasp yet (maybe so)

Everyone in my family enjoyed the movie in their own way, with my children understanding none of the innuendos but still finding it really funny thanks to Scooby-Dooesque chase scenes and comical over the top moment and my wife and I appreciating the meta-commentary and more serious undertone of the movie. The entire audience (Saturday afternoon theatre packed with families) stayed for the whole movie and while not everybody enjoyed it (you can't please everyone), the only person that cried was an infant who needed a good drink half-way through.

All that to say, we had a good time.

- barbie girl is not a song for kids. just because the 90s and 2000s were a lawless wasteland in terms of what media children were consuming, whether or not it was appropriate for them, and EVERYBODY was bumping that song, doesn‚Äôt make it such. 

- pg13 can range from anything a little too much to be PG to being a cunthair below being an R rated movie. what you let your kids watch is up to you, but do your due diligence and take all the blame when you choose not to. 

- even from the trailers it‚Äôs clear this movie was not for the current barbie demographic (children), and was for teens and adults. what 10 year old knows who allan is? or midge?

- it is not the theater‚Äôs job to parent your children. should‚Äôve done your research. kids go to R rated movies all the time and the only restriction is that they must be accompanied by a parent or guardian. i don‚Äôt know if pg13 movies have restrictions for children, but i‚Äôd assume if they did it‚Äôs the same as R. 

- jumping off the previous bullet, the same thing happened with deadpool. parents didn‚Äôt do their research, took their children to what they assumed was a fun superhero movie like the other marvel movies, and acted outraged at literally everything but themselves for what their children were exposed to.

Because it already lists the rating *next to the movie* when you choose it?

How many times does it have to warn you over a fairly tame rating, all because you can't do your job as a parent?

1659,"These parents blaming the movie for what their kid saw instead of doing research first and realizing this was NOT a kids movie.

She says half the theaters are filled with parents bringing their kids. That was not the case at all in the one we went to. There were some kids (inappropriately young for this movie- but it was their parents choice) but the majority was teens and adults, as it was intended to be. I also didn‚Äôt see a single parent storm out of the theater upset. Then she goes on to say how the kids who‚Äôs parents did allow them to watch it will bring back all this inappropriate knowledge to her precious baby. Sorry to tell you sweetheart, but your kid is being exposed to stuff worse than this from their playmates. There are soooo many Barbie movies that are family friendly. It is ok for there to be an adult themed one. My 15 year old thought it was hilarious and I don‚Äôt regret taking her. Because, as I am a responsible adult, I did my research on the movie before buying the tickets and knew that it would be appropriate for my child. Had there been nudity or sex in it, I wouldn‚Äôt have taken her. If you don‚Äôt want your child exposed to adult themes- be responsible and check the movie out first!

1715,"Maybe I'm just dumb or something but I went into Oppenheimer thinking it was PG-13 and then realized after *that* scene that it wasn't.

People have busy lives and I suppose it can happen  that sometimes they forget to check these things. I mean I think most ppl would assume a Barbie movie is PG. Considering it's a children's toy.

But this is all BS. I watched Transformers 2007 as a kid, and that movie had so many sexual connotations it was beyond insanity. And those were children's toys too. So maybe it's not a big deal and this mom is being very overprotective of her child.

It's clearly not bashful or super inappropriate. And I think a 10 yr old kid wouldn't even get half of the weird stuff happening.

Also there's like no sexual content. Ok the Kens are  shirtless but that's rlly as far as it goes?",2023-07-27 15:06:47,1,facepalm,RoyShavRick,comment,Is the Barbie movie really that inappropriate in its first 15 minutes?

She really missed the whole point of the movie, which was that the perfect image of Barbie is itself a facade which, without a reframing of what Barbie COULD truly represent (which perhaps is a return to the original intent of her creator), has and does real damage to young girls and women.

There was content in both of those films for children and adults.  Making a BARBIE movie with the core demographic in mind being adults (or at least young adults) is a bit of a strange move, especially since kids playing with Barbies today will of course want to see the Barbie movie.

2056,"From everything I saw in the television ads it was pretty apparent that it was made for the girls who grew up playing with Barbie‚Äôs not for kids who currently might be playing with them.  Every ad on tv showed and implied that it would be full of references most parents might not want young kids watching.  

Ryan Gosling half naked and saying some adult shit to Barbie plays almost evey 3rd commercial.  Never once did I ever watch that and think that it was a kids movie. Ever lol.  I honestly thought that was their intention was to make a movie that those little girls who are now 30s-40s or older and wanted to remember back to that time.. 

I also don‚Äôt think they ever once had indicated that it was going to be a child‚Äôs movie.. that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs never good to make assumptions I thought we all knew that? 

So I don‚Äôt see why anyone would be offended when they couldn‚Äôt take there 5 or 6 year old and have them hear what‚Äôs said at school and public daily to a movie and hear something they don‚Äôt like lol? 

Who did they really think was the target audience? The current generation who have barely heard the brand or the generations who grew up with every kid playing with Barbie dolls regardless if you were breaking them and hiding them from your cousins/sisters or were actually playing with them. 

The group that had probably rode in a Barbie jeep battery powered toy and was probably the most known toy brand at the time or the current generations who have millions of brands and that‚Äôs if kids aren‚Äôt stuck on a tablet or a phone.  It wasn‚Äôt accidental that the movie was more oriented to the parents and drag their kids along versus marketing to the kids and the parents trying to sit through a kid cartoon or something. 

They are in the business to make money and that‚Äôs the path they followed.. sad part is that the original posters daughter was only that excited supposedly probably because it was the mom hyping her up, you can tell by the story and how long and detailed it is. She was the one probably pushing her to be excited over it and then realized it was teenager/adult oriented and had to eat crow haha üòÇ",2023-07-27 15:46:49,1,facepalm,_Dreadz,comment,Is the Barbie movie really that inappropriate in its first 15 minutes?

2074,"I‚Äôm guessing she‚Äôs never seen Gremlins. 

Gremlins is the reason the PG13 label exists. Gremlins is also still rated PG, I think. 

I was 9 when it came out and 10 when I finally got to see it on cable. I only knew one kid who had nightmares from it but the rest of us now have a lifelong love of shitty horror movies. 

Part of the reason I want to see the Barbie movie is because of the PG13 rating. Usually that happens when they‚Äôve got a story line that they don‚Äôt want to dumb down and sanitize. Which tells me that the story line will be harder for kids than the regular stuff that is put out for them. Which likely means I‚Äôll actually enjoy it.  I just haven‚Äôt had the chance to see the film yet. I‚Äôll probably end up waiting till it‚Äôs on Netflix or HBO. So I can enjoy it in peace at home. 

The other thing is that you can‚Äôt just assume that a film or book or anything will be appropriate for your child. I used to routinely see things twice. Once to check it out for myself & then once again with the kid. It also depends on the child. The main thing to remember‚Ä¶ NEVER ASSUME.

30min in there are a few stereotypes of toxic masculinity shown and the words Penis and Vagina are said (which a 13+ person should have learned by then).

2375,"I would respect the PG-13 rating and not allow your children to see Barbie. The sex jokes and innuendo along with the foul language, light violence (it really is quite light, just to be clear), alcohol (specific scene), blatant sexism (note: this is integral to the film's messages), romantically charged scenes (limited), and some pretty raw thoughts about death make me reluctant to advise any parent that this film is totally kosher for kids. Teens? Absolutely. Bring em. 

There's a lot of existentialism in the film (it's a central theme) that poses questions we generally have no problem posing to children 6-12 years old in a religious setting (What do you think it means to die? How do you think you'll change as you get older?), but if you're not the sort of parent that things big questions like that should be presented to kids early on, I'd avoid the film.

My friends were similarly free to watch whatever the hell they wanted, outside of straight up porn. And last I checked, none of us turned out to become degenerates or anything.

Kids can handle most of that stuff just fine. You just need to be responsible enough as a parent to have a conversation with them and put whatever they see into context.

2610,"I havent seen the movie yet, but I asked an 18 and 19 year-old about it.

18 year old- ""Kids should be 16+ to watch this movie.""
Rating: 7.5

19 year old- ""No one under 18 should go see this movie. 
No one who wants to be happy, should go see this movie. 
You should only watch this movie when and if you want to think about your life and where youre at in life. It's a bit depressing.""
Rating: Between 8-9

I agree with the sentiment of this mother. 
I personally feel as adults, we already have lots of choices in movies. To release a Barbie movie; something moms buy for their daughters until the age of 13, and have it NOT be for them (pg-13) is so selfish of an adult to do. These young girls should feel entitled to this movie üé¨ and have every right to be upset and throw tantrums that it wasnt written for them. It should be theirs. It should be for every age in America to enjoy!",2023-07-28 03:51:32,0,facepalm,KayHonest,comment,Is the Barbie movie really that inappropriate in its first 15 minutes?

2613,"As the generations go by, I do find some kids are getting smarter and a bit less innocent. In that age I remember not getting a lick of sense on those pop culture media disguised as for kids, but when you take a closer look it's not. But these new generation of kids seem to understand a bit more, which is concerning. For countries who don't have a high crime rate, you might not notice it. But for countries that do, some last couple of years I find news about young kids committing crime so easily just because they threw a tantrum.

So it's no wonder why parents want to be more careful about what content their kids watch. People underestimate how pop culture media can have strong influence to children. I'm one those pop culture media victims and let's just say, my relationship with my parents is most of the time like a time bomb.

47,"I was surprisingly intrigued by the first trailer but now knowing the direction the film takes with the 'real world' its no longer very interesting to me. 

The real world plot has been done quite a lot and after the first trailer I was more interested in what story they would do purely set in Barbieworld than whatever fish-out-of-water Barbie in the real world story they've gone for. It actually feels like a too-safe story choice to go for a toy realises they're a toy.

Also the Ken 'but I'm a man' joke doesnt really seem to fit the character. Wouldn't a bunch of jokes where he believes he is qualified for every profession fit better because of all the job outfits the toys have been given over the years? Would've been a better joke if he kept trying to claim he's a doctor but no one believes him because of his clothes and that he's just walked in off the street. He could constantly be trying to do all sorts of jobs like a lifeguard, or a fireman, or chef, not because hes a man but because he's had those professions back in Barbieworld but no one will let him in the real world.",2023-05-25 20:33:07,27,movies,LordDusty,comment,Barbie | Main Trailer

As in, the Lego movie has so many layers that made it a love letter to fans; from the stop motion animation style, to every piece being an actual Lego piece, to just being an actual Lego adventure (something a kid would make up in their head) etc.

I feel like this movie could have benefited from the ""Barbie"" world being actual barbies (like CG versions ala Toy Story) and then the ""real world"" is more just a story of a girl coping with real-world problems. In a way, it's almost like Inside Out mixed with Lego movie. But idk, this trailer makes the movie look really insincere.

615,"All the people who are shitting on Oppenheimer in this thread and supporting this movie better show up to theatres. Otherwise its gonna be nuked at the worldwide boxoffice!.

Because i am sure that nolan fans will definitely be watching Oppenheimer on the big screen especially for the 70mm imax experience. A lot of general audience are also aware about Nolan films and will also add heavily to the world wide box office which may even cross 500mil.

People underestimate nolan's pull at the box office but don't realise the fact that tenet did 340 mil during peak covid with 50% occupancy reduced in all theatres and that was his most criticised movie till date. All of his previous movies were hit at the box office with the likes of inception,  interstellar and dunkirk doing big business and running in theatres for months.

If you think barbie will beat Oppenheimer at worldwide box office then it has be one of the best movies that wb has made in years. I hope it is good and does well but there is no need to shit on a movie made by a director whose filmography speaks for itself.
Excited to see this clash and if both movies live up to the hype its going to be one hell of an event for moviegoers. 

Good luck!

662,"Ever since this movie was announced I was super excited and now I'm even more stoked for release date. I used to play with Barbies when I was little and I trust Greta's vision because I've enjoyed every film she's directed so far and I know she'll do this one justice. I've always considered Barbie a feminist icon so I'm fully here for films featuring the female gaze. In the immortal words of Reese Witherspoon - ""women's stories matter - they just matter!"" 

Everything about this whole promo cycle has been really fun to witness. The marketing campaign, the Vogue shoot, the posters, the trailers and ofc the pure campiness of it all is right up my alley. I like things that are tongue in cheek and self-referential (and funny) so I'm more excited now than I was when it was first announced.  This will be my Joker. I just know it. Apologies in advance for the person I will become on July 21st. Can't say I didn't warn you ü§≠",2023-05-25 23:41:14,0,movies,QTPIE247,comment,Barbie | Main Trailer
